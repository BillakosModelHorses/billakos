<P>This particular model horse show has an entry fee. In this page there is more information on why I chose not to make it free, some useful instructions on how you can register your horse as well as some extra helpful things you should know before entering the show.</P>
<P>Starting with the instructions, first you have to make a donation of $3 to my PayPal account by clicking the yellow box that directs you to the Paypal page. <span style="color: #FF0000;">When donating, please add your omhps username in the comments in order for me to know who you are and add you to the entants list. Unable to do so, I won't be able to add you to the show.</span>
Afer the donation, you will have to add your username to the list on the main model horse shows page. Then I will match the username you provided me during the donation with the username on the list. Then I will add you to the show. If you don't add your username on the main model horse show page but you add it to the donation comments, don't worry, I will add it myself so I can keep track all the entries. Please see the scedule below that has all the dates and find out the period you can pay your entry fee.</P>

<P>The reason I am doing a paid show this time is because I want some help in order to maintain and improve this blog/website. My goal is not to pocket the money, but to use it to enhance this space for everyone. Your contributions will go directly toward covering the necessary fees and expenses I have to pay to keep the site running. Any extra money will be donated to a wonderful local charity, which provides care and support for equine animals in need: <a href="https://espihelphorses.org">www.espihelphorses.org</a>.</p>

<P>Because this is a premium show, I will also send the winners virtual rosettes/cards as a bonus for their models achievments! The winners can print them and keep them in their placing files. Who gets virtual rossetes/cards? For Classes - the top 6. For Sections - the top 3 (Section champion, Section reserve champion, Section reserve to reserve champion). For divisions - the top 3 (Division champion,  Division reserve champion, Division reserve to reserve champion). The top 2 in each class will qualify.</P>
