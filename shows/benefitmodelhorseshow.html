<h4><span style="color: #FF0000;">In the show rules it says that performance classes don’t have a limit on the entries you can submit. However, there was a mistake when creating the show, and the limit is currently set to 3. I will try to contact OMHPS to have them changed to unlimited!</span></h4>
-->
    
<P>This model horse show has an entry fee. On this page, you’ll find instructions on how to register to the show, the schedule and other helpful details to know before entering the show.</P>

    <p>Starting with the instructions, first you have to make a payment of $4 via Friends and Family to my PayPal account by clicking the box that directs you to the PayPal page. <span style="color: #FF0000;">When paying, please add your OMHPS username in the comments so I know who you are and can add you to the entrants list. If you are unable to do so, I might won't be able to add you to the show.</span> After the payment, you will have to add your username to the list on the main Model Horse Shows page (link in the page menu and below). Then I will match the username you provided during the payment with the username on the list. After that, I will add you to the show. If you don't add your username on the main Model Horse Shows page but you include it in the donation comments, don't worry , I will add it myself so I can keep track of all the entries. Please see the schedule below, which has all the dates, to find out the period when you can pay your entry fee.</p>

<p><span style="color: #FF0000;">There are no refunds.</span></p>

<P>The reason I am hosting a paid show is because I need some support to maintain and improve this blog/website. My goal is not to keep the money for myself, but to use it to enhance this space for everyone. Your contributions will go directly toward covering the necessary fees and expenses required to keep the site running. Any extra funds will be donated to a wonderful local charity that provides care and support for equine animals in need: <a href="https://espihelphorses.org">www.espihelphorses.org</a>.</p>

<P>Because this is a pay to enter show, I will also send the winners virtual cards (they look like certificates with special horses I drew on them) as a bonus for their models’ achievements! The winners can print them and keep them in their placing folder. Who gets virtual cards? For Classes - the top 6 (6 for 30 or more entries, 5 for 25 or more entries, 4 for 20 or more entries). For Sections - the top 3 (Section champion, Section reserve champion, Section reserve to reserve champion). For Divisions - the top 3 (Division champion, Division reserve champion, Division reserve to reserve champion). The top 2 in each class will qualify. <span style="color: #FF0000;">The people who are eligible to get a card must contact me via email at billakosmodelhorses@gmail.com.</span> I might be able to find some of them myself, but I can never be sure.</p>
