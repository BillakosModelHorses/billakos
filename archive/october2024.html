    <h3>October’s sneak peak</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 31 October 2024</p>

    <p>Breyer sent out this month’s newsletter to the collector club members and there was a sneak peak in it!</p>

<p>I don’t know what this could be… Maybe it’s a vintage or stablemates club release. Maybe it’s not. The colors remind me of Madonna (SM club 2025 release) but without the fleabitten dots. We have to wait to find out! Byeee :)</p>

    <h3>BF 2025 Celebration horse!</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 30 October 2024</p>

    <p>Breyer finally announced the Breyerfest Celebration horse for 2025! It is a gorgeous fleabitten gray and has the name Tight Lines aka Phish. There is also a very nice blanket that comes with the horse! Here is a link to the YouTube video that shows the real horse and it’s story: https://youtu.be/2hqSEvn6YYs?si=UdNan4gfwHnnqFmL</p>

<center><p>The way that the rider talks about Phish is very moving and shows the love and gratefulness for him :)</p></center>

    <h3>Small Updates!</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 29 October 2024</p>

    <p>Hello, everyone! Today I’ll cover a few topics, including Breyer releases, a parcel I’m expecting, a project I’m working on and some other stuff.</p>

    <p>Starting with the Breyer releases, they finally announced the optional release for the Vintage Club, and this year it’s a bit different. Instead of a Traditional scale horse as they usually do, they decided to make a stablemate set of 5 featuring both vintage and modern molds in some older colorways. I have to say that the price tag of $145 plus shipping and handling seems high to me. If we break it down, it’s approximately $30 per stablemate. The good news for some, is that it’s optional, so if you don’t agree with the price, you can simply opt out. Another thing I noticed is that there was no Classic scale model for the club this year, which I thought was a standard feature.</p>

    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/jSRzgTwY/IMG_0450.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>

    <p>Two other models that appeared on a webshop some days ago are two decorators. The first one is Radiance, which is Breyer’s 75th Anniversary horse. Its mold is the classic Arabian mare, released in 2024. The next one is a camo horse, believed to be the 2025 Hope Horse, named Aspire.</p>

    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/4N66Qy31/c2afa6eaac2172abf01483cc2a7769f5ed7a241a_radiance.jpg" width="400" height="400"> <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/yY4hRc7d/image.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>

    <p>I’m not a huge fan of either of these horses. Out of the two, I prefer Radiance because I’ve never liked camo colors.</p>

    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>

    <p>A few days ago, I found a sale ad featuring some very interesting horses, including a volunteer model! The best part was that I really liked it, and it was located in Netherlands, so I wouldn’t have to spend a fortune on shipping and customs or wait too long! The model I’m talking about is the 2012 Breyerfest Volunteer model, Keighley. I’m very excited to add this horse to my collection, but I might have to wait until the 8th of November to unbox her (it’s my second name day because I have two names and wanted to give myself a gift).</p>

    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>

    <p>I’ve started another sculpting project, and I have to say, I’m not very good at it (lol). I’ve tried many times to make a 3D horse but have failed so far. Well, I might get better with practice but idk. I’ll make a post about my attempts in the future, but this is the current one (my best so far because it's a medalion).</p>

    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/7ZXSjR0G/IMG_0483.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>

    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>

    <p>I don’t know if you saw, but I made myself a logo! This is the original version and the Halloween themed one. The horse was drawn by me a few years ago, and I thought it would fit perfectly with the blog/website theme.</p>

    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/nLyg39tP/6205-B9-F2-AE7-D-4105-AE47-78-BF6-B5-B531-A.png" width="325" height="325"> <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/tgygjx9L/D947F77C-6AD6-4F92-B60F-83D61FC1348E.png" width="325" height="325"></center>

    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>

    <p>Last but not least, the Breyerfest 2025 Celebration Horse will be revealed THIS WEEK!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
    <p>I hope you all have a wonderful day :)</p>

    <h3>Breyer Midwest and Mangoky!</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 21 October 2024</p>

    <p>Hello everyone! Today, Breyer made an  announcement about BreyerWest. Many people had been anticipating this change, especially since last year's Denver Rocky Mountain Horse Expo was noticeably under attended. This likely influenced Breyer's decision to relocate the event. Instead of hosting it in Denver, Colorado, this year’s event will take place at EquiFest in Salina, Kansas. Since this location isn’t technically in the West, they’ve also decided to rebrand the event and BreyerWest is now BreyerMidwest! The event is scheduled for March 21-23, 2025.</p>

<center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/0jBcDHRT/101524_Blog-BMW-STD_1800x1000_5a5ac015-ec29-4382-9e63-78b045fe6fa8_1024x1024.webp" width="410" height="248">  </center>

<p>Furthermore, Collector Club members received an email today with the opportunity to enter for the latest model in the Wild Animal Series, named Mangoky. This model is inspired by the Madagascar lemur and the mold used is Valegro, which I think is a brilliant choice. The price is $185, and it will be limited to 750 pieces. If you're a member, you have until October 23 at 11:59 PM EDT to enter.</p>

    <center><p>Who wouldn’t want King Julian in their collection?</p>

    <h3>Will the Ideal Series end soon?</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 21 October 2024</p>

    <p>There is a theory circulating that the Orren Mixer's Ideal series might be coming to an end soon. When Breyer first launched the Ideal series, they informed dealers that they planned to conclude the collection with a buckskin horse (they might changed their mind since then). In the latest Holiday catalog that breyer gave out, a buckskin horse on the Geronimo mold appeared (the same mold used for the other horses in the series, with the exception of the pony). This could potentially be the final horse in the series or perhaps a new portrait horse. Alternatively, it might simply be an OOAK from Breyer's archives, used to showcase the western tack set in the advertisement.</p>

    <h3>Breyer 2025 Clubs so far!</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 19 October 2024</p>

    <p>This post might be a bit early, and I’ll likely make another one when we get more details about the three specialty clubs. So far, Breyer has only announced the Collector Club.</p>

    <p>This year looks very exciting just for being in the Collector Club. It appears that there will be another club event, plus a new store exclusively for members to purchase Collector Club merchandise and models. This is a new feature for this year, and we’ll have to wait and see what exactly this store will offer. Additionally, as always, they’ve revealed the first special run, which is Maddox. It is a stunning dapple gray on the Akhal-Teke mold. Some familiar benefits remain unchanged, such as the 10% discount, access to other clubs, workshops, exclusive blogs, and a copy of the JAH magazine (I still haven’t received mine).</p>

<center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/PxFRPXzT/C6-A89946-1-F70-4421-A713-D891-D93-CA3-A3.webp" width="412" height="331">  
  <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/63QPW2ZM/3-BE93191-CACC-417-F-8-CF4-A45-A769-E7-FC1.webp" width="412" height="331"></center>

<p>As for the Deluxe Collector Club, I was right about the mini version of a popular mold, but I never expected there would be two Stablemates! This year, they’ve scaled down the Semi-Rearing Mustang, and members will receive Darius, a Bay Appaloosa, along with an extra Stablemate of the same mold in a random color. Here are the four possible colors:</p>

    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/VvrHtxDM/41-CDF98-C-F3-DC-4-E33-855-E-54-B25490-B51-B.webp" width="412" height="331"></center>

    <p>My favorite is the Wedgewood (solid blue), but I wouldn’t mind getting any of the other options! Along with these Stablemates that ship for free (yay!), you also get a pin featuring Maddox.</p>

    <p><center><span style="color: #00FF00;">Pricing</span></center></p>

<p>The pricing has increased again this year. I believe the club cost $25 in 2023, went up to $30 in 2024, and now it’s $35. The Deluxe option was $65 last year and is now $85 ($70 and $90 respectively for international memberships). If you want to join for the rest of 2024, it’s an additional $10 for each membership. In my opinion, the price increase for the Deluxe option makes sense because it includes an extra Stablemate but the increase in the regular membership fee without any additional Stablemate or pin seems a bit unfair.</p>

<p>I will probably join the Deluxe Collector Club again this year as I really like the Stablemates and will probably also like the pin!</p>

<p><center><span style="color: #2c789c;">Premier, Stablemates and Vintage club</span></center></p>

    <p>Yesterday, someone shared a photo in a Facebook group that shows one release for the 2025 Premier Club and one for the Stablemates Club. I also noticed that the Vintage Club will have 1,200 members this year, which is 200 more than before.</p>

<center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Kj6pD0HW/A8921040-1790-41-C4-B3-C6-092-CAACFBC07.jpg" width="400" height="322"></center>

<p>I was right about the Premier Club too! I expected a new mule mold, and here it is! This makes joining the club very tempting, but I don’t think I will. The second horse in the image is a beautiful Arabian mare with blood marks. Initially, this model looked familiar, and I wasn’t sure if it was new or not. Then I saw a post from modelhorsecollectibility.blogspot.com, which explained that Hagen-Renaker allowed Breyer to scale down one of their models.</p>

<center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/d06Xcmh7/76-D64930-5-FB1-469-D-B815-90-F94-E971349.jpg" width="434" height="260"></center>

<p>We’ll have to wait a few more days until Breyer shares more information about the clubs and their pricing. We’ll probably see every release from the Stablemate Club, at least one from the Vintage Club, and maybe another Premier Club mold without its coloring before the end of the year, as they did last time.</p>

<p>Have a great rest of your weekend!</p>

    <h3>A few Breyer Updates</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 19 October 2024</p>

    <p>Happy weekend everyone! Today's post is going to be a bit long, as Breyer announced several things that I’ll cover them all here!</p>

    <p>First, Breyer has released this year's holiday Mare and Foal set. Freya & Annika come packaged in a beautiful bag that includes an extra ornament in their colors, which I find very cute and amazing. When I saw this set, I considered buying it because they are not unicorns or decorators like last years. If I make another purchase from Breyer's website, I might add them to my cart. Another release is this year's classic winter decorator named Nor'easter. To be honest, I’m not a big fan of it. I’m quite picky when it comes to decorators, and this one doesn’t look like a model I’d add to my collection. Of course, they also released some holiday merchandise, such as hoodies, mugs, pillows, etc., but the item that caught my attention the most is a throw blanket that features the cover of Breyer's 1963 catalog. They also made 3 holiday blankets that are shipped randomly, but my favourite has to be the bottom one...</p>

<center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/gkQHH7GS/F1-B966-EA-5150-4-AAE-BE8-D-4-A9-F105-F0630.png" width="412" height="309"></center>

<p>Next year is the 75th anniversary and they of course added some merchandise items for this occasion. This includes some clothing items, a pin, a mug, and two blankets for traditional horses.</p>

    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/qMzGnrH6/69-BEA993-AD87-4494-BBF2-C1-E8-DF8-CB603.png" width="412" height="309"></center>

    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>

    <p>Now, here are some other interesting updates that I’ll go through quickly:</p>
<p>1. Breyer has announced the list of models that will be retired by the end of 2024, which you can check out <a href="https://www.breyerhorses.com/blogs/news/the-2024-breyer-retired-list">here</a>.</p>

<p>2. Yesterday, Collector Club members had the chance to get a free glossy regular run model with the Collector Club appreciation offer, but it sold out within 2 hours.</p>

<p>3. Today is the National Fun Day, which includes online workshops open to everyone! You can find more information about that <a href="https://www.breyerhorses.com/blogs/news/national-fun-day-2024-schedule-and-locations">here</a>.</p>

<p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>

    <p>Lastly, the Collector Club membership for 2025 has opened, and there are some exciting stuff about it. Plus, I just saw a post featuring one Premier Club model and a release for the Stablemate Club (I’m not entirely sure if this mold is new or not). I’ll make another post later today or tomorrow to dive into those details!!</p>

<p>As always thank you so much for reading this! See you in the next one very soon :)</p>

    <h3>Collection Showcase #4</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 15 October 2024</p>

    <p>October means Oktoberfest! (This post was intended to go up earlier in the month, but I forgot.) What better way to celebrate than by showing you some of the Breyerfest 2022 models, as the theme was Prost!</p>

    <p><center><span style="color: #000000;">Nikolas</span></center></p>

    <p>Nikolas was the celebration model for that year. He was sculpted by Bridgette Eberl, and the first release of the mold was actually on him! As you might know, I got my first Breyer Traditional horse at the beginning of 2022, so that was the first year I wanted to join Breyerfest. I bought an online Traditional Access ticket, which came with Nikolas. I remember watching this <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7q1wwxbik?feature=shared">video</a> and getting very excited. During BreyerFest, I didn't get any other model except Nikolas, but when he finally arrived all the way from the US, I was very impressed! According to the IDYB page, 12.354 of these were made.</p>

    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Qt9gnyGM/0-A3-CDDB5-B2-F9-481-A-BCCF-8-F3-A0-D517688.jpg" width="403" height="302"></center>

    <p><center><span style="color: #DD0000;">Brahms</span></center></p>

    <p>Brahms was a present from my parents for my 18th birthday! He was a special run for that year, but I got him from a shop in Europe the next year (instead of during BreyerFest). I really liked the Big Ben mold, and I've always loved leopard Appaloosa horses, which made this particular model really stand out to me, especially in the glossy finish. The run number is 2.200.</p>

    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/x8Lv9NdD/9-FC49-D1-D-2648-47-E2-821-C-8-FE9-A62-EAC5-D.jpg" width="403" height="302"> <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/pVjYf4JG/2-DDD49-C4-5025-41-CD-B5-D8-8-FF1-B8-B28529.jpg" width="403" height="302"> </center>

    <p><center><span style="color: #FFCC00;">Chablis</span></center></p>

    <p>I got this horse during BreyerFest 2024, two years after its release! To be honest, I never considered getting this horse until I saw him in the background of a video. The real horse is very beautiful, and I think Breyer did an amazing job creating its portrait model (the Idocus mold fits perfectly). Both online and in-person BreyerFest attendees could get him in the store. Chablis is a limited edition with 3.000 pieces made. Sadly, mine doesn't have many dapples, but it was the one I could find at a reasonable price, so I don't mind that much.</p>

    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/63kVsftf/DE6-A3147-62-FA-4749-8-FBF-FDD1-B36-D752-F.jpg" width="403" height="302"></center>

    <p>Thank you all for reading this Collection Showcase edition! Have a nice day :)</p>

<p>It was in fact this year’s pony for Christmas! It’s really frustrating that whenever I purchase something from Breyer’s website and pay a small fortune on shipping, the next day they release something amazing like this pony! I’m not sure if I will get it but I love it! Hot cocoa is such a cozy theme and the blanket is very beautiful!</p>

<p>I don’t know if anyone reads my blog but if you do please read this: I've been feeling really low these past few days, knowing that I’ll soon have to say goodbye to my beloved grandma. It's such a difficult time right now, and I’m struggling to find any motivation to write or do much of anything. I’m sorry if I don’t post for a while (I have 2 posts that are ready and will probably use those instead of nothing).</p>

            <h3>2025 Clubs speculations</h3>
            <p class="date">Published on 6 October 2024</p>

<p>Happy Sunday! It’s finally October, the time of year when Breyer typically announces next year’s clubs! I’ve been thinking about what they might do for 2025, and I wanted to share my speculations and ideas with you.</p>

<p><center><span style="color: #2c789c;">Collector Club</span></center></p>

<p>For the Collector’s Club I have no idea on what they could do. The only thing I can think of is that they might feature vintage molds/colorways. As for the exclusive Stablemate for the deluxe membership, my guess is that it will be a miniaturized version of a popular traditional mold but that is not unique as they have done that before.</p>

<p><center><span style="color: #2c789c;">Stablemates Club</span></center></p>

<p>About the Stablemates Club, I believe they’ll continue shrinking popular molds from different decades. There are typically six releases (plus one optional model), and I expect each to represent a horse from a particular era, ending with a brand-new, modern sculpture as they do every year. They could scale down some beloved molds from previous decades that collectors have been eager to see as Stablemates. Imagine a mini Ethereal!!</p>

<p><center><span style="color: #2c789c;">Premier Club</span></center></p>

<p>I have two ideas for the Premier Club next year. The first is that Breyer could introduce new sculptures people have been asking for, such as a Friesian, a donkey, or even a mule. The second idea seems a lot unlikely to happen but they could bring back sculptors from the past who created iconic molds. They could remake their original works in a modern style. While it’s more likely that Breyer would hire newer sculptors to do this, having the original artists return would make the molds extremely special and iconic.</p>

<p><center><span style="color: #2c789c;">Vintage Club</span></center></p>

<p>Next year’s Vintage Club is going to be interesting, especially with Breyer celebrating its 75th anniversary. Typically, each release in this club honors Breyer’s history, but I think for such a milestone, they’ll do something truly exciting and different. While I can’t pinpoint exactly what, I believe Breyer will surprise everyone with something unique to mark this important occasion.</p>

<p>All in all, I’m really interested to see what next year will bring. It’s definitely going to be fun! Have a nice rest of the day :)</p>

            <h3>Collection Showcase #3</h3>
            <p class="date">Published on 3 October 2024</p>

      
<p>Happy Spooktober! Today, I will be showing you one model from each of Peter Stone’s scales!</p>

<p>First, we have an adorable Chip horse on the Quarter Horse mold. I acquired this model from a Stablemate lot, and unfortunately, I don’t have much information on when it was produced or how limited it is.</p>

<p>Next is the Pebbles scale! I found this beautiful Warmblood at a great price, and I couldn’t resist buying it. I believe it was a regular run in the early 2000s, but I’m not completely sure.</p>

<p>The last and largest scale is the Stone (1:9). I have two Stone horses, and today I’ll show you Cutter. He’s on the ISH (Ideal Stock Horse) mold, and he was a regular run released in 2002.</p>
