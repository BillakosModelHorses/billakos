    <h3>2nd and Winter Medallions</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 31 December 2024</p>
    <p>Welcome to the last post of 2024! At some point, I talked about my sculpting attempts, and I mentioned that I was working on another medallion. I finished it but forgot to show it to you! It’s the face of a horse. I wasn’t sure about it until I baked it! It turned out very cute, and I’m happy with how it came out in the end. This perspective was outside my comfort zone, but for the first time, I believe it’s not that bad.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/2yKMnpgG/IMG_1803.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>The next horse is the Christmas/Winter special for 2024. It is a Fjord horse with a blanket! I was originally planning to make it with a background but then decided not to. I might create a complementary piece that will connect like a puzzle and say something like “Happy Holidays” or “2024.” I’m not sure yet.</p>

</center>
    <p>EDIT: Before posting this, I actually made something that connects to the model! It includes a snowman, a tree, and the year 2024 on it.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/hjgBGBq7/IMG_1806.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>I hope you like them as much as I do! See you in 2025 :)</p>

    <h3>Collection Showcase #7</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 28 December 2024</p>
    <p>Hello Santa's little helpers! I decided to show you 3 Winter themed horses today! Two of these are some of my favorite models in my collection, and I believe you will love them as much as I do!</p>
    <p>The first one is Astrid! I got this mare from da Vinci Creations in March 2023! Fjord horses have always been one of my favorite breeds, and I had to get Astrid. The glossy version was my top choice as it makes her color really pop. Her coat is called Grå, and she has a stripe down her back plus a star on her head!</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/j5VQgwTT/88177EE2-53C8-401A-BDE7-0B02C1196D56.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>Astrid was released in 2021 as part of the Premier Club. Members could choose between Matte or Glossy versions.</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>The next horse is a stablemate Fjord I randomly have in my collection. It is from the Blind Bag Surprise Series 3.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/SNmVbMMN/2CCED4A6-FD77-486C-8416-6FE544131CBD.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>Last but not least, this is Neva!!! When he was released, I was amazed by the snowman markings. Unfortunately, I did not get him at the release, and then he sold out. In September 2023, a shop in Europe put some up for sale, and I quickly snatched one. When he arrived, I resisted the temptation to open him and waited until December 25th. It was incredibly difficult to have a model and not open it, but I managed, and it made Christmas feel even more special!!</p>

</center>
    <p>Neva was the Winter Classic for 2022, and you could only get him directly from Breyer.</p>
    <p>I hope you enjoyed today's Collection Showcase! Have a great day :)</p>

    <h3>2025 Releases (RR, Clubs)</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 26 December 2024</p>
    <p>Hello! As you might have seen, Breyer has revealed some more 2025 Premier and Stablemate Club models. Moreover, someone leaked the regular run releases from the dealers' catalog. I am going to show them to you and, because there are many, I will only comment on those that made an impression on me (good or bad).</p>
<center><p><span style="color: #2c789c;">Stablemates</span></p></center>
    <p>There are two new sets and a new unicorn mystery bag series! I don’t mind the jewels (deco set) or the unicorns, but the bigger set… OMG. I have been waiting for this Fjord forever! I love almost every horse, and I will buy it for sure!</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/65hj80Xv/0C1F2FFA-9BDC-4399-83F1-B35F824BF526.png" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
<center><p><span style="color: #2c789c;">Anniversary Models</span></p></center>
    <p>There are four anniversary models! Three are for Breyer’s 75th birthday, and they match my prediction for the molds they would use. We still have to see the other two, which will be in the mid-year releases. Regarding the silver horse, it is a commemorative model for the 85th anniversary of the American Quarter Horse Association.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/XJFx4KLX/38C4D151-CC40-4568-8C18-924AED0AC614.png" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>I’m not a huge fan of any of these models, and I don’t know if I will end up getting one.</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
<center><p><span style="color: #2c789c;">Other Regular Runs</span></p></center>
    <p>Breyer finally made a Big Lex model! I really like it, but even though it’s something that excites me, I don’t know if I want it in my collection. As you can see, there is another palomino mustang and a pony on last year’s Welsh Cob mold.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/02vX54Lv/5DAA157C-E060-428B-99D1-0A9C7BAE6FE7.png" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
<center><p><span style="color: #2c789c;">Halloween, Holiday, and… A BULL REGULAR RUN!!</span></p></center>
    <p>When I saw the images, I only focused on the horses, and the information that there is a longhorn bull did not register in my brain! When I realized it, I was shocked! I really want this model and can’t wait for it to be available here!</p>
    <p>As for the Holiday horse, I love the mold they used (Flash) and the coat, but the costume is not my favorite. Regarding the Halloween one… I hate it. I have arachnophobia, and I just can’t see it. They used a mold I love, but the spider as a marking is just disappointing and disgusting to me. Of course, many people will disagree, but I’m not looking forward to seeing it everywhere in October.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/2Sc0wS3j/7E1CC828-27F7-4E15-B996-C65CB28EFB92.png" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
<center><p><span style="color: #2c789c;">Premier Club</span></p></center>
    <p>I did mention Roman in a previous post, but not only did they reveal his color, they revealed a mane/tail/breed variation! This is from Breyer’s website: “Members can choose between a hardy, loose-maned Highland Pony stallion or a sleek, braided British Riding Pony mare! Kelly spent many hours getting their details just right—from hardy conformation, an archetypal cresty neck, and a thick, full mane for our Highland, to a finer body, feminine expression, and perfect turnout for our British Riding Pony. Both are moving at the trot with strength and ease.” The last reveal is Cosimo, an Italian Murgese stallion sculpted by Sarah Minkiewicz-Breunig.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/6Q8Y1xGr/809F8F6B-3C8E-437C-9E73-465D52778E21.png" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>I don’t think Breyer has ever revealed all three models for the Premier Club. Rowan has to be my favorite, and if I joined, I would choose the braided version. I might be able to find one secondhand. All three Premier club models are amazing, and I would gladly join the club if it wasn’t so expensive.</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
<center><p><span style="color: #2c789c;">Stablemates Club</span></p></center>
    <p>For this club, we got another compulsory to buy model and the special run for 2025. Alana is the black tobiano pinto Tennessee Walking Horse. Harbinger is the Pegasus! This is the groundbreaking model Breyer was talking about earlier, and I think it’s fabulous. Wings fit this mold extremely well!</p>

</center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>I saw this message from Triple Mountain and thought it would be good to share:</p>
    <p>“We know everyone is excited, but keep in mind that the new releases will be available for a whole year, and there is no scarcity (other than if there's a Flagship model). Just as you're no longer excited about Morganquest Native Sun or Marc of Charm, this year's models will be around long after the excitement ebbs. I hope that will reduce the anxiety some collectors create for themselves around this time of year.”</p>
    <p>Thank you for reading today’s post! Bye :)</p>

    <h3>Tannenbaum -2024 Holiday Surprise</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 23 December 2024</p>
    <p>Hello! Exciting news: Breyer announced this year’s holiday surprise model, and it’s on the Fell Pony mold! The model, named Tannenbaum, comes in four colors: blue, red, green, and coal. It’s priced at $135, with a total run of 3,025 pieces, including just 24 in the rare coal color. I’m curious if the three “common” colors will have different run numbers. As much as I love the design, I decided to pass on this one, even though members get free shipping. Honestly, I might have been tempted to grab it if I hadn’t bought Ivy just five days ago!</p>

    <h3>Collection Showcase #6</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 19 December 2024</p>
    <p>Hey Collectors! Welcome to Collection Showcase number 6!! Today I will show you 2 traditional horses and 1 classic that I have in my collection.</p>
    <p>Starting off with a classic, I have a regular run on the Rearing Stallion mold, originally created in 1965 by Chris Hess. I chose this model because I’ve always liked the Traditional Fighting Stallion and I thought that the silver bay coat looks great on this mold. As I’m writing this, I just realized something! The Classic mold isn’t exactly the same as the Traditional! I always thought they just shrunk the Traditional mold, but it turns out they didn’t.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/TPV6bYCS/IMG_1671.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>The second horse is the Traditional Fighting Stallion, created in 1961 by Chris Hess. This stunning glossy chestnut pinto model was originally made for Breyer’s 70th Anniversary in 2020 and was later glossed for the Collector Club Appreciation Event!</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/05c9ZjP1/IMG_1663.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>I found this guy on eBay, and my parents got him for my 19th birthday. Breyer hasn’t published an official run number for this model, but while reading a list from the Boo Photo Show, I discovered that there might be fewer than 160 made, which is insane!</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>The last model I’m going to show you is a more modern one, Adamek! He’s a gorgeous regular-run Akhal-Teke released in 2022. I’m including him here because I got him along with the Classic Rearing Stallion. What I love most about him is the mapping on his head. There aren’t many regular runs with that level of detail.</p>
<center>

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/zXv8QNGb/IMG_1669.jpg" width="250" height="400">
</center>
    <p>This mold is incredible and so dynamic. The only downside? It takes up a lot of space!</p>
    <p>I hope you liked todays models! Byee :)</p>

    <h3>New models and Updates!</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 17 December 2024</p>
    <p>Happy Tuesday! I’m so sorry that I haven't been very active lately, but there are many things happening in my life! I was in Prague, and when I came back, I had to complete an assignment for my uni. Then, I had show jumping competitions and yesterday, I also had a test for uni as well! As you can imagine, I haven’t had time to upload anything here even though there were some very interesting and exciting things happening regarding Breyer!</p>
    <p>First of all, 2024 Premier and Stablemates Club members can purchase the last releases. For Premier, it’s Bandalero with the very cute laying foal bonus Stablemate, Enya. For Stablemates, members can purchase Augustus and the optional model Hadley and Holden that comes with a gambler's choice foal!</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>Regarding the 2025 Stablemates Club, we got two more reveals for next year! On the left, we have Spencer, a very beautiful Appaloosa, and on the right is Javier, which will be a matte-glossy split!</p>
<center>
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/qqNnkp9D/8225FE53-5BDA-479D-9CAD-C8ED49CF6DA9.webp" width="400" height="400">
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/PJ0DJBHX/2097932A-8F07-43EF-AA28-59B5915D5362.webp" width="400" height="400">
</center>
    <p>I still don’t know if I will join the Stablemates Club. The reveals so far are okay, but except for Madonna, the others don’t excite me that much.</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>WinterFest! Where is it, though? Breyer last year introduced a new holiday event that took place online in December. It wasn’t big or anything, but it was very fun, and I personally really enjoyed it. There were workshops, two special runs, and my personal favorite was the broadcast. It was cozy to watch it during the Christmas break, and I was looking forward to it this year as well! This was not the case… My theory is that it wasn’t very profitable, as the special runs both showed up this year in Breyer’s online store. Even though there won’t be any WinterFest this year (probably), I really hope they will offer us a broadcast.</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>We finally got the winter decoration for 2024, but with a twist! In previous years, this model was offered for purchase to the lucky Collector Club members who got picked in a draw. This year, they decided to let everyone get it, meaning Courchevel is available to all members. It is a first-come, first-serve model. The run number is unknown, which is why there is some disappointment among collectors, as they believe that the $155 price tag is very high if the run number is large (making it a bit less limited). On the other hand, the shipping is free, but this doesn’t apply to international members like me.</p>
<center>
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/CM2kcfq3/C5448B8D-A9B1-4D8C-B910-20F976FD7C4F.webp" width="400" height="400">
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/L6Zfw6kn/E82A638A-F1D7-4AE0-8DB5-678B8DA9D844.webp" width="400" height="400">
</center>
    <p>I can’t hide that I’m very dissatisfied with Breyer, as I believe they should not include free shipping in the price if it doesn’t apply to international collectors too! It’s very unfair for us to have to pay extra for a model’s price that includes shipping to the US and then have to pay extra for international shipping.</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>Enough negativity! Yesterday, Breyer announced another sculpture for the Premier Club next year. This is Rowan, "a delightful Highland Pony stallion sculpted by Kelly Sealey of the United Kingdom. Kelly spent many hours getting his details just right—from his hardy conformation to his delightful personality. His archetypal cresty neck sports a thick, full mane, and he's moving at the trot with strength and ease."</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/9MXVk0H7/rowan-shopify_1235x994.webp" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>I really like this mold, and I can't wait to see the final piece!!</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>This is my horse! He is in the competition facility stable, and I think he looked very sweet. We entered the 1.10 class on Thursday so he could get used to the indoor arena that hosted the event, and on Saturday, we jumped the 1.15-1.20 course!</p>

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/zfpRKLNP/IMG_1615.jpg" width="300" height="400">
</center>
    <p>Last but not least, I finally found a Polo pony in a good price here in Europe. I have some other models waiting to be opened as well, but I will wait until Christmas or new year to free them. I will show them to you later!!</p>
    <p>Have a nice day, everyone! :)</p>

    <h3>75th Anniversary Lonesome Glory</h3>

    <h3>A little bit of everything</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 1 December 2024</p>
    <p>Hi everyone! In Tuesday, I visited Germany for three days! It wasn’t a "for fun" trip but rather for my parents' work. Still, I had an amazing time exploring the cities of Nuremberg and Munich. There were Christmas markets with Glühwein and hot cocoa, which made the experience even more better. I’m thinking I should really start posting about the places I’ve visited. Here are some pictures I took:</p>

    <p>Regarding Breyer, while I was there, they announced a second Black Friday sale. I was a bit nervous since I’d be out when the sale happened. As I mentioned before, I really wanted to get Reykjavik and hoped there’d be a chance for him to go on sale. When the sale started and the new products appeared, I quickly scanned the listings but didn’t see him. However, Peregrine caught my eye! I didn’t want to spend money unless it was for Reykjavik, though. Even if I had wanted Peregrine, I probably wouldn’t have been fast enough as he sold out in one minute! These were all the models available:</p>

    <p>We also got another sneak peak on one of the releases of the Stablemates Club for next year. This is Mercutio and he is on the mini Othello mold!</p>

    <p>I really like his color and the gloss makes him look just amazing. I really want to see all the other releases and maybe I will join the sm club?? Idk...</p>

    <p>As always, Collector Club members received a sneak peek of an upcoming model. This month, members were shown this:</p>

    <p>I believe this will be this year’s holiday web special. Some people think it might be one of the Christmas surprise models, but I doubt it. Why would they reveal it so early?</p>

    <p>If you’ve checked out my mini-game, you’ll notice there are new models to catch! Feel free to recommend more horses for me to add, but make sure their images have a transparent background. I’ve also updated the search engine in Stable Stories, so you can now search for whatever you want. Plus, I added a "go to the top of the page" button to make navigation easier!</p>

    <p>While in Nuremberg, I visited a store with metal figurines, and when I found the horses, they looked so familiar. It turns out they were copies of Breyer Stablemates models! I ended up buying one because it looked so cool.</p>

    <p>The last thing I wanted to mention is that my Just About Horses magazine arrived! I honestly thought I wouldn’t receive it or that it might get lost, but I was wrong. When I returned from my trip to Germany, I found it sitting on the kitchen table!</p>

    <p>I still can’t believe it’s already December. It’s time for the Advent calendars! I didn’t get myself one this year, but a kind lady at a train station in Nuremberg gave some mini chocolate ones to everyone, and I ended up getting one! Now, I have something to open every day. I hope you enjoyed this post! Have a nice day :)</p>
