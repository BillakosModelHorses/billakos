            <h3>September's CC sneak peak</h3>
            <p class="date">Published on 30 September 2024</p>

<p>Happy Monday! Breyer teased an upcoming release that will be revealed next month. I’m not sure what the horse will be, but I have a feeling it could be a web special or the Christmas pony for this year, though I could be totally wrong!</p>

    <h3>Breyer Club releases</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 24 September 2024</p>

<p>Hi everyone! Breyer released even more horses today.</p>

<p>The first one is the 4th Vintage Club release: "Outlaw", a gambler's choice on the Buckshot mold. These are the 3 colors:</p>

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Jn53PkF5/A9-BE9176-2211-403-D-A2-D0-19-EB23-C60863.webp" width="412" height="331">

<p>My favorite is the blanket Appaloosa, but I would be happy with either the buckskin or paint. Sadly, I’m not in the Vintage Club this year, but I hope I can join next year.</p>

<p>This year's Vintage Club bonus stablemate is Felix, and it comes inside the box with Outlaw.</p>

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/C5MGtKTT/A449-C420-AB7-E-4-F13-B72-F-8-B9-BEA4-C3679.webp" width="412" height="331">

<p>Horatio is here! Many Collector Club members who chose the Deluxe subscription can order the bonus stablemate and pin free of charge. I’m so happy I don’t have to pay for shipping!</p>

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/MT9ZrQ0x/dlxsm-product-480x480.webp" width="400" height="400">

<p>I’m not sure why they didn’t announce him 5 days earlier (when Antonia was released) so that people who wanted Antonia could add Horatio to their order and not have to make a separate one. To me, that would’ve been better since I wouldn’t have to wait for two parcels.</p>

<p>In other news, I managed to find Calista from a shop in England!</p>

            <h3>Collection Showcase #2</h3>
            <p class="date">Published on 22 September 2024</p>

      
<p>In the first collection showcase I showed you my first model horse and my first Breyer stablemates. Today I will introduce you to the first 2 traditional horses I ever got.</p>

<p>My first Traditionals were a New Year's gift in 2022. In Greece, many families don’t open gifts on December 25th but wait until January 1st, after the new year begins. That’s when I opened mine, and the first traditional horse I saw was Catch Me! I was completely shocked at how big he was. I wasn’t expecting a plastic horse to be that large, since I was only used to Schleichs and Stablemates. Then I opened Theo, the horse I had been most excited about. Owning a Traditional horse was something I had wanted for a long time. In 2020, I discovered the hobby and Breyer horses, and I really wanted to be part of it. Unfortunately, being in Europe meant I had to spend a lot to get them from the US, so I gave up on the idea for a while. Before Christmas in 2021, my dad asked me what I wanted for the holidays, and I mentioned that a Breyer horse would be amazing, but I couldn’t find any in Europe. Later that day, he easily found a store in Germany that sold them (I felt pretty silly for not finding it myself!) and told me to pick two. For my first models, I chose Theo, whom I adored, and I specifically wanted a sport or warmblood horse to start with so I chose Catch Me.</p>

<p>Catch me was released in 2019 and he is a regular run model.</p>

<p>Theo was released in 2021  and he is also a regular run model.</p>

            <h3>Holiday 2024 Playset</h3>
            <p class="date">Published on 20 September 2024</p>

      
<p>I found a picture of this years holiday pony playset! It is called "Holiday Pijama Party" and the price will be $60.</p>

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/7Zb8XY9y/B-HP-10116-Holiday-Pajama-Party-50696.jpg" width="410" height="317">

<p>This theme is really cute!  The blanket matches perfectly with the red halter and the teddy bear is the very cute. Sadly I am not a doll fan and that is probably the reason why I don't have any playset from Breyer yet. However I really like the doll's clothes as they fit with the horse's tack!</p>

            <h3>Update</h3>
            <p class="date">Published on 19 September 2024</p>

      
<p>I ended up getting Antonia and because she was $65, I also got Norwich without exceeding the $100 for the shipping (if it’s more than $100 the shipping cost gets higher).</p>

   <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/z3YZwbpz/60-AC1-D88-3-FE9-48-F2-AB7-D-ACE72-A51-EC47.webp" width="412" height="331">

<p>Now I have to wait for around 3-4 weeks but I am really happy I got these two horses!</p>

            <h3>New releases!</h3>
            <p class="date">Published on 18 September 2024</p>

<p>Happy Wednesday, everyone! Today, Breyer announced three new models, and I'd like to share my thoughts on them. Starting off we have my least favourite which is a decorator on the newsworthy mold.</p>

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/GhVF5Bzk/B-TR-10066-Fall-Dec-2024-Zulu-1024x1024.webp" width="427" height="370">

<p>This pony was teased in the August Collector’s Club newsletter, and now it's finally been fully revealed. Zulu is a limited edition available for purchase on Breyer's website and in retail stores. While I think the color and the gloss is pretty cool, I generally don't collect decorator models unless I'm absolutely in love with one (like I was with Neva). For that reason, I don’t think I’ll be adding Zulu to my collection.</p>

<p>Next, we have Calista. When I first saw this horse, I hoped she’d be a regular run because I absolutely love her. The chestnut coat looks stunning on this mold but unfortunately for me, she’s a brick and mortar special run, meaning I can’t get her at retail price and will likely have to buy her from a reseller. The same happened with Kendall but thankfully I found one new in box in Germany!</p>

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/WpKq2BrV/B-TR-10007-Calista-Brick-Mortar-01-1024x1024.webp" width="425" height="290">

<p>Lastly, Breyer sent an email to Collector’s Club members about Antonia. She was first revealed during BreyerFest, but tomorrow, September 19, at 1:00pm EDT, she will go on sale. While I really like her, I’m still undecided about whether to purchase her or not. I might wait to see her price and if something else from the website exclusives catches my eye to help me decide. There is always the option to opt out and save money for another model!</p>

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/wjRVq53f/091124-SOC-IG-B-CS-10041-Antonia-CC-1080x1080-KM-22123b40-ed17-4e07-9449-41c30d5136c5-844x844.webp" width="420" height="420">

<p>Thank you for reading that. If anyone wants to sell a Calista at cost and ship her to Europe please let me know.</p>

            <h3>My model horse plans</h3>
            <p class="date">Published on 14 September 2024</p>

<p>Happy Saturday! Today I will tell you a bit more about the plans I have for my collection. They are basically four, but I am really excited about them.</p>

<p>First of all, I really want to start showing. I don’t know much about it yet, but it looks like a lot of fun. Unfortunately, in my country, there aren’t many collectors, so live showing would be impossible. The only option is photo showing, which also seems fun. Last year, I made an account on <a href="https://www.omhps.com">OMHPS</a> and entered some classes (I placed 1st twice with two horses, but no other placings), and then I quit. Next year, I might enter the Breyer Bootcamp, but I will have to read the description and rules first. Another plan is to join the Vintage Club this year. In the past, I really wanted to join the Premier Club, but after a while, I really enjoyed the Vintage Club releases and how they celebrate Breyer’s history. I also wanted to join last year, but I decided to try the Collector’s Club instead to see how things work and next year, I will probably try to get a spot.</p>

<p>The other two plans involve crafting. Almost since I started collecting Breyers, I’ve wanted to make my own model horse and 3d print it. I started one project, but it failed. Then I began a second one, which didn’t fail as badly, but let’s just say it wasn’t great. My third attempt was nice (at least to me). The problem is that I don’t have a 3D printer, and without one, I can’t do much. Now I want to try and make a medallion, which won’t be too hard to mold and cast if i succeed. I will talk more about the 3D horses I’ve made (tried to make at least) in another post. Last but not least, I want to make a simple diorama to take pictures of my models. I’ve gotten many ideas over the past couple of months, and I think I’m ready to start building it!</p>

            <h3>Collection Showcase #1</h3>
            <p class="date">Published on 10 September 2024</p>

            <p> Welcome to the first collection showcase! In this series, I’ll be sharing my models, explaining how and where I got them, along with some additional interesting details about each one. </p>

<p>For the first showcase, I decided to show you my first ever Schleich (my first model horse ever), and my first stablemates that started my love for Breyer horses.</p>

<p>My first ever model horse was a Schleich Friesian. I don’t remember exactly when I got it, but I do recall being at a toy store near my house, where there was a stand filled with Schleich animals, including horses. After picking up that Friesian, I started buying more both to collect and to play with. Schleichs became my favorite childhood toy, and since then I have collected many. While I don’t plan to feature them all here, I might share some of the ones that hold special meaning to me.</p>

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/kM8CxNRH/IMG-0065.jpg" width="403" height="302">

<p>The next model is my first ever Breyer horse! It was sometime around 2017 and I was out with my family when i entered a hobby store. They had some Stablemates on display for just €2, and they immediately caught my eye. I spent a bit of time looking at them, unsure which one to choose, but eventually, I decided on the Hanoverian gelding. When we sat down to eat at a restaurant, I unpacked the horse and was truly amazed with its quality. I had expected the figure to be made of soft plastic, but it was much sturdier and of far better quality than I imagined. I was so impressed that I went straight back to the store and bought a few more! </p>

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/wMKdCMZF/IMG-0062.jpg" width="403" height="302">

<p>These are the other Stablemates that were available in the store. I don’t quite remember which ones I bought on the day I found the Hanoverian gelding, as I ended up revisiting the store a few months later and purchased the rest!</p>

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/kXmmwVxg/IMG-0063.jpg" width="483" height="290">

<p>As you can see I have played a lot with these horses.</p>

<p>Thank you all for reading that, if you like it please let me know in the comment box. In the next showcase I will show you the first 2 traditional horses I ever got! </p>

            <h3>Upcoming Peter Stone molds</h3>
            <p class="date">Published on 7 September 2024</p>

            <p> The Peter Stone company changed owners early this year. During the announcement live stream they also revealed two brand new sculptures. One mare with the name Volo and her foal Pimento!</p>

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Dfqn2tbj/F1111-F6-A-E479-4993-ADB7-5-AF29-DE4558-D.jpg" width="400" height="400">

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/3Jtgcf9N/F696807-C-E754-4-CB2-A800-D98-FE50941-E1.jpg" width="400" height="400">

<p> A few days ago, I came across a post showcasing a new Chip Draft foal named Violet (I was so happy when I saw this one because chips are so adorable). In the image it's just the prototype of the horse, and of course, not the final product.</p>

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/gjqWNZWF/AB3-B4932-9-DEB-44-B8-8-E6-B-C4-DE58-BE0603.jpg" width="400" height="400">

<p>All these amazing sculptures were created by the talented Maggie Jenner-Bennett. In my opinion, the recent additions to the Peter Stone collection are incredibly exciting. It feels like the company is expanding, which suggests they’ll continue to release even more amazing pieces. I truly love Stone horses, but the newer models seem a bit pricey to me, leaving me with mixed feelings. I admire them, but they’re just out of my reach. However, if the company continues to grow, perhaps the prices will become more affordable in the future.</p>

<p>I got all these images from Peter Stone’s social media.</p>

            <h3>Breyerfest Haul 2024</h3>
            <p class="date">Published on 6 September 2024</p>

            <p>Hello again! I’m a bit late to the party, but here’s my Breyerfest 2024 haul! This was my third online Breyerfest, and I purchased some of the models before the event and some a bit afterward.</p>
            <p>The first horse I got was Kirk! When I saw the promo for the 2024 Vintage Club, I knew I had to get Kirk at some point because he's a Nightlamb. As soon as Breyer released him, I quickly searched for him on eBay and managed to snag one! He became the most expensive horse in my collection, but I have zero regrets about it.</p>

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/bYnGY8St/54126-FEF-D32-F-415-F-81-B0-36-C790010-BD8.jpg" width="403" height="302">

            <p>Next up are the models I got straight from the Breyerfest store. In the Special Run preference form I filled out in June, I selected the Surprise Model and Fighter & Survivor. Initially, I wasn't planning on getting both because it would be quite expensive, but I figured I'd wait to see the surprise variations and mold first before deciding. I also had my eye on the Limited Edition Stablemate, Wild Things. (Last year, I missed out on Buggy, a horse I loved.) In the end, I sold my Surprise horse even though I liked every variation, and instead, I got Fighter & Survivor and Wild Things.</p>

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Kzk1Mh9C/DFD03509-78-C1-4044-A21-E-E8-CF7-BBD93-D9.jpg" width="403" height="302">
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/GmdTSN2s/4-A72-EC0-F-05-D3-4-A93-B661-8165-AAC4-CE47.jpg" width="403" height="302">

<p>For Wild Things, I was initially hoping for the standard variation, but when I opened it and saw the green one, I instantly changed my mind and fell in love with it.</p>
<br>
<p>Of course, I also got my Athenian Lady with my online ticket! I was really nervous about the condition of the models that Breyer would send, but thankfully, mine arrived undamaged.</p>
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/W4fDz17M/5-D388778-8-B5-C-4-C81-A403-F2781-C49-C6-A8.jpg" width="403" height="302">

<p>The next model I picked up was on the Monday after the Breyerfest weekend, from a seller in Europe. I found Chablis at what I thought was a great price (especially for Europe), and I couldn't let such a pretty model slip through my fingers!</p>

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/13BVxHn7/DCD0-AC7-B-1352-4-B0-C-8-FB2-2-E6-C9-EF56-DC9.jpg" width="403" height="302">

<p>Last but not least, while browsing eBay just for fun, I came across one of my grails: Lillian and Molly (the 2019 Vintage Club model). I couldn’t find any other listings for this set, so I decided to get it because who knows when I'd have another chance to find this pair!
</p>

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/B6rX57kb/E4420637-4879-4-B44-9-DE3-182338-F45687.jpg" width="403" height="302">

<p>All in all, this was my Breyerfest 2024 haul. I really enjoyed this year's live broadcast, workshops, live auction, and more. I’m already looking forward to Breyerfest 2025 and seeing what Breyer has in store for their 75th anniversary!!</p>
