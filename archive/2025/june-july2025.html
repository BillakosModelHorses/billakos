    <h3>Salzburg, SR numbers, sale and model spoilers</h3>
     <p class="date">Published on 31 July 2025</p>
    <p>Hey! In the last two weeks, there have been quite a few updates from Breyer! The special run and surprise model numbers got revealed, there’s a new web special, an early holiday sale with exclusive models for CC members, the monthly sneak peek, and lastly someone I wanted to talk about!</p>
    <p>Starting off with the special run numbers, I wasn’t too surprised by the 75 piece runs until I saw Shindig!! How cool was that? It’s also crazy to see people paying over $2200 for one. Hoopla had an interesting split too, with only 25% of them being glossy.</p>
    <p>As for the surprise model, the numbers weren’t too shocking:</p>
    <p>-Matte Silver Bay – 1150 pieces</p>
    <p>-Matte Blue Roan – 1625 pieces</p>
    <p>-Matte Dapple Grey - 965 pieces</p>
    <p>-Matte Flaxen Liver Chestnut – 1020 pieces</p>
    <p>-Matte Palomino Tobiano – 870 pieces</p>
    <p>-Glossy Silver Bay – 384 pieces</p>
    <p>-Glossy Dapple Grey – 384 pieces</p>
    <p>-Glossy Flaxen Liver Chestnut - 384 pieces</p>
    <p>-Glossy Palomino Tobiano - 384 pieces</p>
    <p>-Glossy Decorator - 634 pieces</p>
    <p>My order hasn’t arrived yet, but it should get here next week, though I’ll be on vacation until August 27th, so I’ll have to wait to open it. I’m really hoping for the Glossy Palomino Tobiano, but honestly, I’ll be happy with anything except the decorator (which I’d probably try to trade).</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
          <p>Next, about the person I wanted to mention: there’s someone in China who somehow gets access to unreleased models and sells them on an eBay like site. Thanks to them, we already saw the TCS models and the bonus Stablemate for the Vintage Club before they were officially announced. Last week, while reading the Breyer forums, I came across what looks like the upcoming Christmas Morning Surprise: it’s Merry Dancer, and the original poster mentioned there might be two different colors too.</p>
    <p>Being curious, I looked up the seller’s page and was shocked to see what I think is the next Exotic Destinations web special, Salzburg. This happened the day before Breyer officially announced it! It even sold for about $35, which is unbelievable. The unreleased version had black spots instead of brownish ones—I'll add the photos below so you can compare.</p>

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/xdPVkmR6/O1CN010MDe8y1FVNwDXtTL3_!!4611686018427382652-0-fleamarket.jpg_Q90.jpg_.webp" width="400" height="400">
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/tRvythHf/O1CN01w7bTWu1FVNwCKMg7F_!!4611686018427382652-0-fleamarket.jpg_790x10000Q90.jpg_.webp" width="400" height="400">

</center>
    <p>About the other model (Merry Dancer), I’m pretty shocked. Imagine if the whole Christmas surprise got leaked months before December... this really needs to stop, because it ruins the fun for everyone. I really don’t want to see them leak more unreleased models. I’ll only share the image of what might be the Christmas surprise, since there’s still a chance it could be a regular run or something else.</p>

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/268Rn59r/ojthwmqslopjkjk5boqp.jpg" width="400" height="400">
</center>
    <p>Now that Salzburg is official, here he is in the website images:</p>

</center>
    <p>I actually got picked and ended up buying him, even though the timing wasn’t great for me financially. I really shouldn’t have spent extra on other models right now, but oh well. I couldn’t resist, especially after I saw Nero the Stablemate was also available.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/1zBNHV1M/2DBBF295-C081-4AE7-92E9-3DDA20F4CDEF.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>Breyer also had their usual Christmas in July sale, and there were some pretty nice models available just for Collector Club members. One of them was Cardinal, which sold out almost instantly. Magpie sold out super fast too. Some older CC models were listed at surprisingly low prices even cheaper than some current Regular Runs! Here’s everything (for cc members) they offered:</p>
<center>
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/kG66qj6h/IMG_4221.jpg" width="400" height="400">
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/26XLpp6Z/IMG_4222.jpg" width="400" height="400">
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/3Rw0brKh/IMG_4223.jpg" width="400" height="400">
</center>
    <p>Like I said, I really wanted Nero, but I didn’t want to pay international shipping just for one Stablemate. Once I got chosen for Salzburg, though, it felt like the universe telling me to go for it anyway lol.</p>
    <p>Lastly, here’s the sneak peek from July’s newsletter:</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/bYWS3j4X/IMG_4275.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>I personally think this will turn out to be the Halloween classic model.</p>
    <p>Thank you for your time to read my post! Stay tuned because in one of my next updates, I’ll show you the last medallion I finished a while ago but forgot I even had. I’d also love to make more collection showcase posts soon. Have a wonderful day :)</p>

    <p>Before finishing this post, Breyer opened the registrations for the Hoofbeats & Maple Treats Event. We did not see any pictures of the event models, but we got the names: Legacy and Tamarkuz which I already guessed (check the post that was published on 18 June 2025). Legacy seems to be the show jumping horse on the promo picture. I searched it up and Legacy was in fact competitor in the 2024 Paris Olympic games like we can see in that photo.</p>

    <h3>My Breyerfest</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 18 July 2025</p>
    <p>Hello! BreyerFest is over, and I wanted to share my experience. But before that, let’s cover a few things that happened before Friday which I didn’t have time to mention.</p>
    <p>Two of the contest prize models were glossy Salvino and Legend. There was also a secret raffle model that 20 lucky collectors won during the Thursday night party!</p>
<center>

</center>
    <center><p>Glitterbomb</p></center>
    <p>The raffle models were revealed a few days before BreyerFest, and I have to say, especially Cheers, looks amazing. In the live auction, instead of using these two models exactly as they are, they decided to gloss them!</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/d3h6C98s/IMG-3923.jpg" width="700" height="400"></center>
    <p>Lastly, I made some laminated paper horses to keep me company during BreyerFest. I printed out a few of my favourites from my collection, along with some SRs and LEs from this year.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/DmVNyNtk/AC1639B4-219C-462C-94FB-690408346B3D.jpg" width="500" height="400"></center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>As of now, I really enjoyed the live broadcasts and seminars, although I haven’t watched the workshop videos yet. Hopefully, since the content usually stays online for a month, I’ll find time to try making something soon.</p>
    <p>I also bought some models, which I’m very excited about! Unfortunately, I missed out on the online Stablemate because it sold out while I was out for dinner on Friday, which made me pretty sad. Still, I did manage to get Hats Off to You, the surprise model, and also Hoopla, which I really loved. I’m hoping to get a glossy version, but I have a feeling Breyer might surprise everyone with a secret variation that we’ll discover once models start arriving. Of course, this could be completely wrong just like my surprise model prediction! I really didn’t expect them to use Totilas since he was already a prize model, but here we are.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/L54tk3LY/f99qrnjmvvt5czapblk3.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <center><p>Surprise models</p></center>
    <p>I also tried bidding on an OOAK from the live auction. I almost got the Arabian mare and foal set, but someone outbid me. The price I offered was already quite high for me, but I still tried because I absolutely loved that set.</p>
    <p>The special runs this year are really fun ,especially with the secret variations, which seem to be very limited. At first, I thought these might be around 200 pieces, but since so few have turned up, I now guess the run might be closer to 25–50 or 75 to match the anniversary theme.</p>

</center>
    <center><p>Let's get this party started normal and secret variation</p></center>
    <p>Regarding other variations, Future is Bright had the already known short mane version that accidentally slipped in the emails, and Let the Good Times Roll has a matte + braided mane / glossy + long mane split. The exact numbers are still unknown.</p>
<center>

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/8kdXhyQ5/Breyer-Roached-Future-Is-Bright-Breyerfest.webp" width="400" height="400">
</center>
    <p>The online limited editions also have variations. Hoolpa is matte/glossy and Shinding comes in a kind of rainbow color.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/sDV6KpsJ/ox6u26jjcmubea215ghz.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>Something I thought was really clever is the Easter egg on Hats Off to You: the face markings represent Breyer’s 75th anniversary. There is a “7” on top and a “5” on the muzzle. I can’t wait to see mine!</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/HxhKFnzL/IMG_4057.jpg" width="425" height="400"></center>
    <p>The third variation of the volunteer model was also revealed—it’s a mix of the other two, and it looks beautiful. The manager model is the same variation but finished in gloss.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/xdW1Yft6/qxsc7ecusc1ujxkiupju.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>During a seminar with Stephanie Macejko, a brand new sculpture was teased. Nothing official was announced, but it’s a stunning draft horse in a cantering or galloping pose. I think it might be part of the 2026 Premier Collection, or maybe Breyer will release it earlier.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/8P0RWW5c/uie74ggdsaisc0ulz0hq.jpg" width="425" height="400"></center>
    <p>One of my favourite parts is always seeing the Collector Club tent display. Two things really caught my eye: the bonus Stablemate for the Premier Club (which looks fantastic) and the second Collector Club release. Later, Breyer confirmed the CC release will be named Juriann, coming in late October or early November. The deluxe CC stablemates were also displayed and they look very nice in this box that will probably come in with the pin.</p>

    <p>There was also a classic unicorn that is said to be a collector club release but it is still unknown</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/0QPDx0tW/ca67dsivhhvghtrmsgo5.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>Last but not least for Breyer, the live auction models sold on Saturday and the highest price was the Pegasus Alborozo, which went for an incredible $37,500! You can see all the results here: <a href="https://us.bidspirit.com/ui/catalog/auction/breyerfest/62257/1?lang=en">bidspirit.com</a> </p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <center><p>Next year's theme: Midsummer fair!</p></center>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/L5yzxg3y/breyerfest-2026-midsummer-fair-674766-1200x667.webp" width="500" height="400"></center>
    <p>This theme seems very interesting. I believe there will be a lot of Scandinavian horses as special runs and models in general. There will definitely be a Fjord and an Icelandic horse!</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>Peter Stone also hosted an amazing event during BreyerFest weekend called Equilocity. One model that really caught my eye was this one:</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/HxYcFsxF/IMG_4062.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>I don’t know much about Peter Stone events, but I love seeing what models they come up with and always save photos of my favourites in a folder on my computer. I’ll make a post to share them with you soon!</p>
    <p>Another thing I want to mention is this 1:1 horse they had there that seems like something I would want to have in my house!</p>

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/8c37FRHV/IMG_4060.jpg" width="400" height="400">
</center>
    <p>Kylee Parks also made a new sculpture for Stone Horses that I absolutely love. The name is Harmony and it looks incredibly cute.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/B6mL39Pb/IMG_4059.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>I should not forget to mention that some people got this model as a Prize for the Equilocity show.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/5yjHN783/IMG_4061.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>Something interesting that doesn’t have to do exactly with BreyerFest: there is a seller from China who showed two Tractor Supply Company horses. The same person also posted an ad selling the fourth Vintage Club release, which is the clock horse Pioneer. In this ad, there was also a Stablemate that we have never seen before and will probably be the bonus Stablemate for this year. My theory is that this person works at the company that makes Breyers and was able to snag one and sell it. The Stablemate seems to be a mini version of Man o’ War. These are the images I found on Breyer forums:</p>

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/RV9qN098/ilaafbwnb6g0oe5huxnn.jpg" width="475" height="400">
</center>
    <p>On an another not Breyerfest related note, two weeks ago I think, Breyer offered a test run to one CC member. I entered and I would buy it if I was chosen but of course I wasn't picked. The model was on the show jumping warmblood mold and had similar colors with this year's celebration horse Tight lanes.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/MKVBcLhP/VFFo-DLry72rk-Fr-Hsa4l3-G.webp" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>In this post I used many images that I got from other people. If you own one of the images and you want it removed please contact me and I will remove it.</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>Thank you for stopping by to read my post! There were many exciting things that happened during Breyerfest and will continue to happen during the next days as they will probably annpounce the run numbers :)</p>

    <h3>Seize the Day Surprise updated prediction list</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 10 July 2025</p>
    <p>BreyerFest is tomorrow, and I wanted to share my final list with my guess for the surprise model.</p>
    <p>First of all, I had to eliminate the following molds completely:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Anamar, Raffle model</li>
    <li>Marabella, Auction</li>
    <li>Totilas, Prize model</li>
    <li>Georg, Prize model.</li>
</ul>
    <p>And now, here is my final prediction list for the Seize the Day Surprise:</p>
<ul>
    <li>1.Valegro, 2015</li>
    <li>2.Troubador, 2020</li>
    <li>3.Shannondel, 2016</li>
    <li>4.Fireheart, 2021</li>
    <li>5.Ashquar, 2013</li>
    <li>6.Idocus, 2009</li>
    <li>7.Vermeer, 2020</li>
    <li>8.Weather Girl, 2011</li>
    <li>9.Marwari, 2012</li>
    <li>10.Strapless, 2003.</li>
</ul>
    <p>For some reason, I think they might pick a mold that turns something this year (or maybe not). That’s why I chose my No. 1 and No. 2: Valegro turns 10, and Troubador turns 5 this year. As for the rest, it’s just based on a feeling, which could be completely wrong!</p>
    <p>My other 3 guesses that didn’t make it into the top 10 are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>11.Forever Saige, 2015</li>
    <li>12.Zafirah, 2022</li>
    <li>13.Goffert, 2006.</li>
</ul>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/HWbrCdCF/IMG-3988.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>I have to admit I’m a bit skeptical about my No. 2 (Troubador), since he was used in the Vintage Club gambler’s choice in 2023. The reason I still included him is because those colors were very similar, and I really think he deserves to be a surprise horse in beautiful colors!</p>
    <p>See you tomorrow for the big reveal :)</p>

    <p class="date">Published on 25 June 2025</p>
    <p>Hello everyone! Earlier this week, I saw a post on Facebook advertising a new website for model horse collectors called Model Horse University. I immediately visited the site and signed up for the collector list called “The NEIGHborhood.”</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/hPTP2GKc/IMG_7824.jpg" width="500" height="400"></center>
    <p>After browsing the website, I stumbled upon a page where people can find various informative links, filtered into categories like tack making, podcasts, and more. The section that caught my attention was the blog category ,because mine fits perfectly there! I filled out a form, and Kerri added it right away.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/4yHjNnWd/IMG_7825.jpg" width="500" height="400"></center>
    <p>I'm very thankful that she created this amazing platform, as I believe it will help many collectors discover others in the community, along with content creators and more. There’s also a lot to explore on the site like workshops, online Zoom calls, upcoming model horse shows, vendors, and so much more. You can check it out at:</p><a href="https://modelhorseuniversity.com">modelhorseuniversity.com</a>
    <p>Thank you Kerri :)</p>

    <h3>Seize the Day Surprise updated prediction list</h3>
     <p class="date">Published on 22 June 2025</p>
    <p>Happy Sunday! BreyerFest is coming very soon, and I wanted to share my updated surprise horse prediction list. At this point, I don’t have a top 10 yet, but I’ve grouped the molds into four categories:</p>
    <p>Red: Molds I’m sure won’t be the surprise model.</p>
    <p>Green: Molds I believe have the strongest chance.</p>
    <p>Yellow: Molds that could be chosen, but I highly doubt it.</p>
    <p>No marker: Molds I’m completely unsure about. They could be the surprise or not at all.</p>
    <p>As I mentioned, this isn’t my final list, and things might change since I’m still uncertain about where to place some of them. I’ll post my top 10 predictions right before BreyerFest!</p>
    <p>Also, I haven’t watched any prediction videos yet like I usually do every year.</p>

    <h3>Auction & Prize models and more</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 19 June 2025</p>
    <p>Hello again! As I promised, I’m making another post to show what treats Breyer has given us!</p>
    <p>First off, we have the latest Vintage Club release, which is a classic gambler’s choice family. I have to admit I’m not a big fan of these models, but if I had to pick a family, I believe I’d go with the first one in the image below.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/qq46hJ0Q/506748280-10161025775281128-8169398257506789104-n.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>Moreover, the first Premier model as well as the third Stablemate Club model have been released.</p>
    <p>Next, before moving on to BreyerFest news, we got the mid-year regular run releases! You can find them here: www.breyerhorses.com/blogs/news/2025-mid-year-additions-to-the-breyer-stable . Aside from the two other 75th Anniversary horses, we also got a portrait horse that I’m very excited about because it’s a POLO PONY!!!! How exciting is that? The tail looks a bit different from the other polo ponies.</p>

    <p>The anniversary horses are nice, but I think I prefer the first three. There are also some other classic models you can check out, but nothing too thrilling for me personally.</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>BreyerFest is in less than a month, and the excitement grows each day! Breyer has even started posting the auction models, which I have to say look amazing!! I’ll share the pictures and comment on the ones I love most.</p>

    <p>All in all, I’m really happy that BreyerFest is approaching. It’s a difficult time for me due to exams this month. After that, I’ll finally be able to enjoy the summer—and the good news is that I won’t have to worry about anything during BreyerFest weekend.</p>
    <p>When it comes to my model horse hobby, I have to admit I haven’t been very active lately. I’d love to do more, but with the combination of limited time and lack of motivation, it’s been hard even to write for this blog. However, I’m still online, keeping up with every update and bit of news in the hobby, and I really enjoy following it that way.</p>
    <p>I also got a new bookshelf with glass doors, which I’m super happy about because I’ll finally be able to organize some models there! Last but not least, my Rustler’s music box broke and I was very disappointed, but I somehow managed to fix it without even realizing how.</p>
    <p>I’ll post my updated surprise model list in the coming days, so stay tuned :)</p>

    <h3>Delayed May post</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 18 June 2025</p>
    <p>Welcome to the post that was supposed to go up on May!</p>
    <p>There are many things regarding Breyer and PeterStone.</p>
    <p>First of all, Breyer announces the 4 models for the Collector Club Appreciation event. The models are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Atlanta–Cossaco</li>
    <li>The Ideal Series Pony of the Americas</li>
    <li>Quietway Spinabbey.</li>
</ul>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/pT3Jr3bP/collector-club-appreciation-model-may-2025-club-model-breyer-439024_600x600.webp" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>As always, members had to purchase regular items with a value of $150 or more to qualify for the free model. I was considering ordering a few things I wanted, but decided not to. I would really love a Cossaco or an Atlanta in glossy, but I might get one in the next CCA later this year.</p>
    <p>For the Premier, Stablemates, and Vintage club members, Breyer released grab bags with models from previous years. The prices were:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Premier: $195</li>
    <li>Stablemates (2 models): $55</li>
    <li>Vintage: $160</li>
</ul>
    <p>As I have seen, the models that people received were incredible. I kind of got a bit jealous because someone got Nugget. One person got 2 gambler's choice Stablemates. In general, I have seen some very cool models. The thing I really don't like is that there is no COA in Vintage Club models if you don't get them in the original release.</p>
    <p></p><center>__  _______________  __</center><p></p>
    <p>Now it's time for my favourite part! The next Destination Series horse is Machu Picchu. It is a beautiful dapple black Peruvian Paso with mapped markings. There are 600 made and I really hope I get picked. (I didn't lol)</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/50XmxbrP/machu-picchu-club-model-breyer-923259_600x600.webp" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>Usually I am not a huge fan of black models, but this one really looks high quality. We don't see Collector Club models with mapped markings.</p>
    <p></p><center>__  _______________  __</center><p></p>
    <p>Breyer announced another Collector Club this fall (Hoofbeats &amp; Maple Treats)! This time, it will be held in Toronto, Canada. We still don't know much but the registrations will open in June. From the images of the 2 posters I have seen, we can understand that it will be based on Show Jumping, but the halter on the horse says Tamarkuz, which is a racehorse. I guess we will have to wait a bit to find out more. The dates are October 31st – November 2nd.</p>

</center>
    <p>I will enter the draw as I am really considering going if I get picked. I wouldn't if I knew that there is no chance of going (like last year).</p>
    <p></p><center>__  _______________  __</center><p></p>
    <p>Regarding BreyerFest, there are 2 things I want to talk about. The first thing is the price increase on the models. There is an increase to each model of up to $5 (some models have a $1–2 increase, for example). I'm quoting Breyer's announcement:</p>
    <p>"As of 5/16/2025 – Recently imposed tariffs and rising expenses continue to dramatically affect the cost of crafting Breyer’s products. Unfortunately, we will need to adjust the pricing of BreyerFest products to help absorb this impact. Doing so ensures that we can continue to create and deliver the quality products we all love. Please note that VIP ticket holders will not see a price increase on pre-purchased VIP models. We appreciate your understanding as we continue to navigate economic conditions and look forward to seeing you at BreyerFest!"</p>
    <p>I can't say that I find it fair as many already bought their tickets, but I can't say it's unfair either.</p>
    <p>Moreover, these are the 2 Best Customs Contest winners’ prizes. Szurkol is the winner's prize and Skál for the runner-up.</p>

    <p>Last weekend was the Stone Horse Country Fair. Unfortunately, I don't know much about Stone events, but they look very fun. I will definitely watch videos of content creators to find more about this event, but from what I have seen so far, it is really interesting. I saw many models and the mare-foal surprise on the new mold looked very cool.</p>
    <p>Because this post was supposed to go up last month, I will make 2 other ones in the following days showing the other Breyer news and the updated surprise model list! See you soon :)</p>
