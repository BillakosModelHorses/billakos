    <h3>My top 5 purchases (2025)</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 28 December 2025</p>
    <p>Hello! Today I’ll be showing you my Top 5 purchases of 2025. This year, the selection isn’t very large, but the models I chose are definitely rarer and more expensive. You’ve probably seen most of them in previous posts, but it’s time to rank them, which is going to be hard, because they’re all amazing!</p>
    <p>My top model has to be Midas. He was my holy grail for a very long time. I absolutely love the color, and the mold itself is stunning.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/XvHVDK2H/IMG_2238.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>Second on the list is definitely my OOAK glossy Braided Rowan. I’m incredibly happy and grateful to own such an amazing and irreplaceable model. It’s truly one of a kind.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/FHnnTPxh/IMG_6667.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>In third place, I chose Win, Place or Show. I don’t think I’ve shown him on the blog yet. I acquired him in March, and he’s a beautiful model. He was a diorama prize model, and I’ll be sharing more details about him in a future Collection Showcase post.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/85J6PgsK/IMG_3015.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>Next on the list is Ivy. I technically got this model last year, but she arrived on December 31st, after I had already posted my Top 5 purchases. I really wanted to include her here, as she’s one of my absolute Christmas favorites.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/sXKn6wC8/ADA7874E-89CE-4354-9CE3-6C755A7EED1E.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>Choosing the last spot is always the hardest, because there are several models I’d love to include. However, I have to say that the 75th Anniversary Deluxe Collector Club set was a fantastic addition to my collection. These two Stablemates are beautiful, and since the semi rearing Mustang is one of my favorite molds, they earned extra points for being small and adorable!</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/zGcP8cVZ/IMG_6556.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>An honorable mention goes to Nero, the Stablemate. He was such a pleasant surprise, as I never expected to own him. I usually don’t like spending much money on Stablemates, but since I got him directly from Breyer (with the exact cost and combined shipping along with Salzburg), I’m extremely happy. I love leopard Appaloosas especially on draft horses!</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Qxk6C97W/IMG_5377.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>I hope you enjoyed my Top 5 models of 2025. See you next year :)</p>

    <h3>Christmas Artwork</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 24 December 2025</p>
    <p>Tomorrow is Christmas Day, and since 2022 I’ve been creating a Christmas themed artwork each year. Last year, I actually posted the 2022 piece because the 2024 artwork wasn’t ready yet. Today, however, I’ll be showing you the 2022, 2023, and 2024 pieces in order. I’ve already shared two of the three somewhere on the blog.</p>
    <p>For 2022, I created a cute little Fjord horse walking through a snowy landscape. This piece was a lot of fun to make. I ended up using it for the blog in 2024 and simply changed the date in the corner.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/sgftYNTL/Untitled569_20251218013837.png" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>In 2023, I used the outline from a 3D model I made that year for my Christmas card. You can find the “Summer Horse” in the post I made on 15 November 2024. It’s funny how a summer horse ended up in a winter scene with snow! This artwork was really enjoyable to create, and I was very happy to include my first somewhat decent 3D model in a Christmas piece.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/vZPC3tKX/Untitled652_20251224134748.png" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>Last but not least, in 2024, I didn’t make a painting. Instead, I created a medallion. You’ve probably already seen this one. It works like a puzzle, as you can separate the horse from the “2024” plate. The design features a cute Fjord horse wearing a rug, while the extra plate includes a little snowman and a tiny tree. I really like that in 2024 I tried something different.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/P5fBWRSV/IMG_8055.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>As for 2025, you’ll have to wait until tomorrow to see what it is! All I can say for now is that it’s a digital painting similar to the 2022 and 2023. Maybe I should make a medallion as well… or perhaps next year I’ll do both!</p>
    <p>See you tomorrow :)</p>

    <h3>Trip, Clubs etc.</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 18 December 2025</p>
    <p>Hello! I’m back from my trip to South America! I visited many places, and it was truly an amazing experience. I went to the Amazon Rainforest, Machu Picchu (now I need the model), Rainbow Mountain, Death Road in Bolivia, and many, many more places. It was an unforgettable journey, but I’m also quite glad it’s over, as it was very exhausting.</p>
<center>
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/ZKjDd59K/IMG_6923.jpg" width="400" height="400">

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/J4KdkzyQ/IMG_9560.jpg" width="400" height="400">
</center>
    <p>Everything was beautiful. I saw llamas, alpacas, and so many incredible landscapes. My top 5 experiences were:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The wrestling ladies in Bolivia (a local show where two women in traditional clothing “fake” fight each other)</li>
    <li>Machu Picchu</li>
    <li>The Nazca Desert with the famous symbols, as well as the nearby desert with an oasis</li>
    <li>Rainbow Mountain, which was stunning but very challenging, as we were walking at 5,000 meters above sea level</li>
    <li>and lastly the Death Road in Bolivia</li>
</ul>
    <p>This was an 18 day trip, and while I was in Lima, I decided to check Facebook Marketplace to see if there were any Breyer horses available in Peru. I actually found one very close to where I was staying! I contacted the seller, and he was kind enough to bring it directly to my hotel. It’s nothing particularly special, but it’s a lovely souvenir for my collection and a great reminder of this trip.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/PxzMnSYN/IMG_9611.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>I took this photo in the hotel room to send to a friend. It’s the bay running foal, and I believe it dates back to the 1970s.</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>Moreover, I wanted to share this really cool model I discovered that I didn’t even know existed. It’s the 2024 Stablemates Club model Lanin, but with a long mane instead of the roached mane from the official release. I didn’t know about this variation until AshleyInspirations posted it on the Breyer CC forums. This model was sold at BreyerFest as a test piece in a silent auction at the Collector Club tent.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/qqjY12dm/npumxwazkrt0vrcsbaue.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>Speaking of the Collector Club, I still haven’t purchased my 2026 membership, but I will very soon. I’m waiting for a less exciting day so I can make it special. I absolutely love Lavinia, the first release. I don’t think I’ll be joining any other clubs.</p>
    <p>The Vintage Club sold out yesterday. It took so long that Breyer ended up revealing at least three releases instead of just one. One possible reason is that members no longer keep their assigned COA numbers like they used to, which may have discouraged some collectors. For example, if I had COA number 1 for years and suddenly lost it, I’d be pretty frustrated too. That said, I really like the lamp and foal, the teased circus Stablemate with the traditional fighting stallion, which looks fun.</p>

</center>
    <p>The Premier Club also looks nice, but the rearing Andalusian isn’t really my cup of tea. It’s a transfer from a resin sculpt (originally made around 2005–2006, I believe) to plastic, with some changes as the sculptor has confirmed. My opinion on the Stablemates remains the same as always: some are nice, some less so, and some are really cool. The new bucking mold looks very promising, but we still need to see the color.</p>

</center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>Before posting this, Breyer also revealed the Holiday Surprise model, which turned out to be Merry Dancer. If you check my post from July 31st, you’ll see one leaked pink version that was taken out of the factory and sold on a Chinese website. The person who owned that model also mentioned a black and white (charcoal) version and a purple and white one, meaning the official surprise ended up being the green version. I have to admit, they don’t really remind me of the Northern Lights as much. They feel more like Easter models to me. The only version I truly like is the black one and, to a lesser extent, the green one, so I won’t be getting one this year. I mean what are the chances of getting the charcoal...</p>

    <p>Additionally, a sketch for the third Premier Club model has been revealed, and it’s a Shetland pony! This is very exciting, and I can’t wait to see the final color. A leopard Appaloosa would be incredible. With this reveal, we now know the full Premier Club lineup, but it’s still a pass for me. I don’t want the pressure of committing to every release. I’m sure there will be some surprises later on, just like last year.</p>

    <p>Thank you so much for reading today’s post. I have a few more posts planned before the end of the year, so stay tuned! One of them will be my Top 5 purchases of the year :)</p>

    <h3>Collection Showcase #10</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 21 November 2025</p>
    <p>I got an OOAK! This Collection Showcase post is also an announcement. This is not a regular Premier Club Rowan, it's the one and only glossy mare version! What makes this model truly OOAK is that the factory gloss was applied only to the two special pieces Breyer gifted to the sculptor of the mold, Kelly Sealey. One stallion and one mare. She later offered them for auction, and I managed to get the version I wanted! The COA is a regular one, but Kelly told me she will create and send a special COA for me, which is really exciting. This was also the most anxious parcel I’ve ever waited for, because I needed many, many papers and documents for the package to go through customs. But now I finally have it, and I’m so happy it arrived safely.</p>

    <p>On Monday I’m leaving for 18 days, and it would have been such a bummer to wait that long to get my model. She’s really beautiful in person, and the dapples really pop. I noticed that there is no VIN code under the hoof! When I first saw this model in the Premier Club sneak peeks, I never imagined I would end up with the OOAK glossy version. It feels amazing to have such a rare model in my collection.</p>
    <p>There is also a video by NCModels, who won the auction for the glossy stallion version. You can watch it here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUlM4AqPggQ&t=269s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Glossy Stallion Rowan Video</a>

    <h3>2nd BMH show Horses</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 17 November 2025</p>
    <p>Hello! Now that the first awards have been handed out, I can finally show you the mascot horses for each certificate type. I drew these back in August, and to “unlock” each mascot you had to place in a class, a section, or a division. The Buckskin Mule is the most common one and my personal favourite.</p>
    <p>For the Section Champion, Reserve Champion, and Reserve to Reserve Champion, the certificates featured the Bronco Appy. Division winners (Champion, Reserve Champion, and Reserve to Reserve Champion) received the same style of certificate, but with the rarest mascot of all, the Appy Friesian. I was really happy with how they turned out, and I believe the people who received them enjoyed them as well!</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/bNjH894F/Untitled711_20251117031443.png" width="600" height="400"></center>
    <p>For those who haven’t received their prizes yet, please send me an email (billakosmodelhorses@gmail.com) with your omhps username so I can identify you and send your files via Google Drive. I’m updating the status on the username page as I go.</p>
    <p>I hope you like these horses! They were so much fun to draw, and I will definitely create more “prize” horses in future shows :)</p>

    <h3>Collection Showcase #9</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 31 October 2025</p>
    <p>🎃 Happy Halloween!! 🎃</p>
    <p>Since it’s this spooky day, I decided to show you my two spookier (or more Halloween themed) models! Unfortunately, I don’t (yet) have many Halloween horses in my collection, but I can still share a bit about the ones I do have. I’d love to add Cryptic, Calavera, Frankensteed, or even Frankenstein (lol) to my shelves one day, but for now, here’s what I’ve got:</p>
    <p>👻Spectre! I’ve loved this model ever since the day I saw the leaked catalogue photos! I got him as part of my name day gift from my parents in 2023. The color is amazing, that mix of gold and purple is just beautiful. I actually ordered him while I was away in Mexico and couldn’t wait for him to arrive… he showed up right on my name day!</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/BnVw4VXG/IMG-6553.jpg?v=1733934026" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>The little ghosts are adorable, and the glow in the dark effect is such a fun touch, which is something I really enjoy about all the Halloween horses. I often find myself admiring him before bed. This mold, sculpted by my favorite artist Brigitte Eberl, is phenomenal. I also love that it doesn’t take up too much shelf space (it’s quite compact in shape like a cube). Spectre is model #1876, on the Ashquar mold, and was the 2023 Halloween Horse.</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>This next one isn’t officially a Halloween horse, but its color definitely fits the spooky theme! It’s the Wild Things decorator variation, the online exclusive stablemate from BreyerFest 2024. It came in two versions, and while I was originally hoping for the non decorator one, I ended up really happy with this version. Only 1,050 pieces were made and it's the model #10098, on the Cantering Morgan (G5) mold.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/0yBHPBb1/IMG-6554.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>What I love most about him is the metallic green color. It’s stunning in gloss! The markings add extra personality, too. Overall, it’s a really fun model that gives off a great Halloween vibe!</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>As a little bonus, I wanted to include a few more small models in this Collection Showcase:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The 70th Anniversary Mystery Horse Surprise Woodgrain Clydesdale</li>
    <li>The 2021 Mustang Stablemate</li>
    <li>The Pintos and Palominos Gift Set</li>
</ul>
    <p>In September 2022, my family and I visited Portugal. While there, I found a tack store that carried Breyers and since it was along our route, I convinced my parents to stop by! They had some Classics and Stablemates, but because I didn’t have much luggage space, I decided to only buy Stablemates.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/P5RFTRP5/IMG-3053.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>I was so happy with my finds and super lucky, because I pulled my favorite model from the mystery bag! The Arabian Stablemate is one of my favorites because it’s so dynamic and elegant.</p>
    <p>I took this photo in our hotel room. The Mustang was missing back then, so I took a new photo at home today:</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/4xSFsSmC/IMG-6555.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>As always, have an amazing day and don’t forget to trick or treat! 🍬🎃 :)</p>

    <p>Thank you everyone for supporting my website by entering the show, and congratulations to all the winners! Stay tuned for your rewards :)</p>

    <h3>Model Horse Updates</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 14 October 2025</p>
    <p>Hey guys! I’ve been working on judging the show over the past few weeks, which means I haven’t had much time to write anything here... There’s a lot to cover, but I decided that there’s no reason to announce every single Breyer release/ news unless there’s something I really want to talk about.</p>
    <p>I’ll start with one of the most exciting web specials ever created, which was released two weeks ago. The 2025 Wild Animal Series release, “Iquitos.” This frog-like horse is very unique, and I was really hoping to get picked. Unfortunately, I didn’t, and the secondary market prices were crazy!</p>

    <p>Moreover, Juriann was released and cost $75. Shipping wasn’t included, which actually makes me really happy because it means there’s no overcharge for international collectors. I hope it stays this way, as it also benefits US collectors who want to combine shipping if they add another item to their order (To overpack the order). Another thing to note is the bonus Stablemate for the Vintage Club is indeed a mini Man o’ War, like I mentioned in my previous post (18 July 2025).</p>

    <p>My Deluxe Collector Club Stablemates and pin arrived last week, and I got my second favorite pick! The packaging is amazing, and I really love the premium feel of the set. Darius is beautiful. For the gambler’s choice Stablemate, my preference order was:</p>
<ul>
   <li>1. Wedgewood Blue</li>
    <li>2. Gold Charm</li>
    <li>3. Glossy Copenhagen</li>
    <li>4. Gold Florentine.</li>
</ul>

    <p>Speaking of Stablemates, my dad surprised me with a whole box of Stablemates Mystery Surprise Series 4! Unfortunately, I didn’t get any of the chase models, but I got lucky with one of the Mini Whinnie Blind Barns ,which is a blue chase model!</p>

    <p>In the image, you can see the box before I opened most of the models, along with the chase and some other ponies.</p>

    <p>The last thing I want to talk about is the spoilers we got from the Holiday Catalog, which revealed some of the 2026 Club releases!</p>
    <p>For the Collector Club, we’re getting a Vanner mare for the first release. The Deluxe Collector Club offers Kiana on what appears to be the Madonna mold, along with a bonus pin featuring Kiana! The price for the Deluxe CC will be $80 for the 2025/2026 year. From that information, I can tell that the standard Collector Club will remain $30, and the Deluxe version $70, the same as in 2024.</p>

    <p>The Premier Club is getting Georgina, an AMAZING galloping draft mare!! I’m in love with this one. This was actually the mold that was shown during a presentation at BreyerFest.</p>

    <p>For the Stablemates Club, Astoria isn’t a new sculpture, but a retake on the Belgian Drafter mold.</p>

    <p>As for the Vintage Club, there’s nothing new yet. I can’t wait to find out more about all the clubs. I’ll definitely be joining the Deluxe Collector Club, but I’m not thinking about any others because I don’t really like the commitment that comes with having to buy each model.</p>
    <p>Thank you so much for reading this post! As I mentioned earlier, I don’t plan to cover every release or announcement Breyer makes. From now on, I’ll focus on things that I find interesting or worth talking about  and, of course, more about my own model horse journey. See you very soon :)</p>
