    <h3>Special thanks to Kerri Gehrmann Johnson</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 25 June 2025</p>
    <p>Hello everyone! Earlier this week, I saw a post on Facebook advertising a new website for model horse collectors called Model Horse University. I immediately visited the site and signed up for the collector list called “The NEIGHborhood.”</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/hPTP2GKc/IMG_7824.jpg" width="500" height="400"></center>
    <p>After browsing the website, I stumbled upon a page where people can find various informative links, filtered into categories like tack making, podcasts, and more. The section that caught my attention was the blog category ,because mine fits perfectly there! I filled out a form, and Kerri added it right away.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/4yHjNnWd/IMG_7825.jpg" width="500" height="400"></center>
    <p>I'm very thankful that she created this amazing platform, as I believe it will help many collectors discover others in the community, along with content creators and more. There’s also a lot to explore on the site like workshops, online Zoom calls, upcoming model horse shows, vendors, and so much more. You can check it out at:</p><a href="https://modelhorseuniversity.com">modelhorseuniversity.com</a>
    <p>Thank you Kerri :)</p>

    <h3>Seize the Day Surprise updated prediction list</h3>
     <p class="date">Published on 22 June 2025</p>
    <p>Happy Sunday! BreyerFest is coming very soon, and I wanted to share my updated surprise horse prediction list. At this point, I don’t have a top 10 yet, but I’ve grouped the molds into four categories:</p>
    <p>Red: Molds I’m sure won’t be the surprise model.</p>
    <p>Green: Molds I believe have the strongest chance.</p>
    <p>Yellow: Molds that could be chosen, but I highly doubt it.</p>
    <p>No marker: Molds I’m completely unsure about. They could be the surprise or not at all.</p>
    <p>As I mentioned, this isn’t my final list, and things might change since I’m still uncertain about where to place some of them. I’ll post my top 10 predictions right before BreyerFest!</p>
    <p>Also, I haven’t watched any prediction videos yet like I usually do every year.</p>

    <h3>Auction & Prize models and more</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 19 June 2025</p>
    <p>Hello again! As I promised, I’m making another post to show what treats Breyer has given us!</p>
    <p>First off, we have the latest Vintage Club release, which is a classic gambler’s choice family. I have to admit I’m not a big fan of these models, but if I had to pick a family, I believe I’d go with the first one in the image below.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/qq46hJ0Q/506748280-10161025775281128-8169398257506789104-n.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>Moreover, the first Premier model as well as the third Stablemate Club model have been released.</p>
    <p>Next, before moving on to BreyerFest news, we got the mid-year regular run releases! You can find them here: www.breyerhorses.com/blogs/news/2025-mid-year-additions-to-the-breyer-stable . Aside from the two other 75th Anniversary horses, we also got a portrait horse that I’m very excited about because it’s a POLO PONY!!!! How exciting is that? The tail looks a bit different from the other polo ponies.</p>
<center>

</center>
    <p>The anniversary horses are nice, but I think I prefer the first three. There are also some other classic models you can check out, but nothing too thrilling for me personally.</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>BreyerFest is in less than a month, and the excitement grows each day! Breyer has even started posting the auction models, which I have to say look amazing!! I’ll share the pictures and comment on the ones I love most.</p>

    <center><p>(Lot #7) I love this strawberry roan warmblood and I’m very curious to see how much it will sell for.</p></center>

    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>This is the Open Show Overall Champion prize and the Open Show Overall Reserve Champion prize! The names are Sante and Cin Cin, respectively.</p>

</center>
    <p>All in all, I’m really happy that BreyerFest is approaching. It’s a difficult time for me due to exams this month. After that, I’ll finally be able to enjoy the summer—and the good news is that I won’t have to worry about anything during BreyerFest weekend.</p>
    <p>When it comes to my model horse hobby, I have to admit I haven’t been very active lately. I’d love to do more, but with the combination of limited time and lack of motivation, it’s been hard even to write for this blog. However, I’m still online, keeping up with every update and bit of news in the hobby, and I really enjoy following it that way.</p>
    <p>I also got a new bookshelf with glass doors, which I’m super happy about because I’ll finally be able to organize some models there! Last but not least, my Rustler’s music box broke and I was very disappointed, but I somehow managed to fix it without even realizing how.</p>
    <p>I’ll post my updated surprise model list in the coming days, so stay tuned :)</p>

    <h3>Delayed May post</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 18 June 2025</p>
    <p>Welcome to the post that was supposed to go up on May!</p>
    <p>There are many things regarding Breyer and PeterStone.</p>
    <p>First of all, Breyer announces the 4 models for the Collector Club Appreciation event. The models are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Atlanta–Cossaco</li>
    <li>The Ideal Series Pony of the Americas</li>
    <li>Quietway Spinabbey.</li>
</ul>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/pT3Jr3bP/collector-club-appreciation-model-may-2025-club-model-breyer-439024_600x600.webp" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>As always, members had to purchase regular items with a value of $150 or more to qualify for the free model. I was considering ordering a few things I wanted, but decided not to. I would really love a Cossaco or an Atlanta in glossy, but I might get one in the next CCA later this year.</p>
    <p>For the Premier, Stablemates, and Vintage club members, Breyer released grab bags with models from previous years. The prices were:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Premier: $195</li>
    <li>Stablemates (2 models): $55</li>
    <li>Vintage: $160</li>
</ul>
    <p>As I have seen, the models that people received were incredible. I kind of got a bit jealous because someone got Nugget. One person got 2 gambler's choice Stablemates. In general, I have seen some very cool models. The thing I really don't like is that there is no COA in Vintage Club models if you don't get them in the original release.</p>
    <p></p><center>__  _______________  __</center><p></p>
    <p>Now it's time for my favourite part! The next Destination Series horse is Machu Picchu. It is a beautiful dapple black Peruvian Paso with mapped markings. There are 600 made and I really hope I get picked. (I didn't lol)</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/50XmxbrP/machu-picchu-club-model-breyer-923259_600x600.webp" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>Usually I am not a huge fan of black models, but this one really looks high quality. We don't see Collector Club models with mapped markings.</p>
    <p></p><center>__  _______________  __</center><p></p>
    <p>Breyer announced another Collector Club this fall (Hoofbeats &amp; Maple Treats)! This time, it will be held in Toronto, Canada. We still don't know much but the registrations will open in June. From the images of the 2 posters I have seen, we can understand that it will be based on Show Jumping, but the halter on the horse says Tamarkuz, which is a racehorse. I guess we will have to wait a bit to find out more. The dates are October 31st – November 2nd.</p>
<center>

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/jd0hbV4X/Στιγμιότυπο_οθόνης_(32).png" width="250" height="400">
</center>
    <p>I will enter the draw as I am really considering going if I get picked. I wouldn't if I knew that there is no chance of going (like last year).</p>
    <p></p><center>__  _______________  __</center><p></p>
    <p>Regarding BreyerFest, there are 2 things I want to talk about. The first thing is the price increase on the models. There is an increase to each model of up to $5 (some models have a $1–2 increase, for example). I'm quoting Breyer's announcement:</p>
    <p>"As of 5/16/2025 – Recently imposed tariffs and rising expenses continue to dramatically affect the cost of crafting Breyer’s products. Unfortunately, we will need to adjust the pricing of BreyerFest products to help absorb this impact. Doing so ensures that we can continue to create and deliver the quality products we all love. Please note that VIP ticket holders will not see a price increase on pre-purchased VIP models. We appreciate your understanding as we continue to navigate economic conditions and look forward to seeing you at BreyerFest!"</p>
    <p>I can't say that I find it fair as many already bought their tickets, but I can't say it's unfair either.</p>
    <p>Moreover, these are the 2 Best Customs Contest winners’ prizes. Szurkol is the winner's prize and Skál for the runner-up.</p>
<center>

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/FKWZ57Td/B-EV-10527_Skal_R_1024x1024.webp" width="400" height="400">
</center>
    <p></p><center>__  _______________  __</center><p></p>
    <p>Last weekend was the Stone Horse Country Fair. Unfortunately, I don't know much about Stone events, but they look very fun. I will definitely watch videos of content creators to find more about this event, but from what I have seen so far, it is really interesting. I saw many models and the mare-foal surprise on the new mold looked very cool.</p>
    <p>Because this post was supposed to go up last month, I will make 2 other ones in the following days showing the other Breyer news and the updated surprise model list! See you soon :)</p>

    <h3>Collector Club store, Rambler and sneak peak</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 27 April 2025</p>
    <p>Hey guys! When Breyer announced the 2025 Collector Club, they mentioned that they would make an exclusive store just for the members. After that, we heard nothing about it and it made me believe that they would just cancel this plan. However, one or two weeks ago, they opened this store and it featured some club exclusive models such as Troubadour, Shelby, Santino and some more that you can see in the image down below. Moreover, they made Collector Club merchandise with a tumbler, a pin and a bag. This is very interesting for me as I am really curious to see what models they will put in and if they will announce it or put them at random times.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/mDFzsB6R/31.png" width="600" height="400"></center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>In the past week, they also showed us this year's classic scale gambler’s choice and I have to admit that I LOVE every single variation of it. This mold is amazing. The limit per member is 3 instead of 1, which I think is great for international collectors like me, as they can save a lot on shipping if they want more than one model!</p>
<center>
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/q7FhSzwj/rambler-club-model-breyer-662414-1235x994.webp" width="400" height="400">
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/9f0wLGdD/rambler-freedom-series-gamblers-choice-club-model-breyer-602051-1235x994.webp" width="400" height="400">
</center>
    <p>I really want one of these horses and I am still thinking of getting 1 Santino from the CC store, 1 Rambler, and 1 CC pin but I am not sure yet. I will think about it for a bit.</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>This is the sneak peek for April that Breyer sent to the newsletter:</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/T3CWjkD8/mail.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>There are many speculations regarding this model. They said that this is for CC members, but it could be anything from a special run (which I highly doubt as we got Rambler this month), a web special or even this year's CC Appreciation event because this is a glossy model. I guess we will have to see.</p>
    <p>Before closing this post, I wanted to inform you that I moved the Paddock Chat and you can now find it in the main menu on every page. I moved the Archive page to the Horseshoe menu and it is now accessible from this page (Stable Stories) on the top. Have a wonderful day :)</p>

    <h3>News</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 2 April 2025</p>
    <p>Hello! I have been quite absent in the previous weeks, and there are a lot of things to cover. Starting off with BreyerMidwest that was held on the 28th-30th of March, we saw in person a lot of the BreyerFest Special Runs and limited editions. My favourites were Hats Off to You and this year's online exclusive Hoopla! Volunteers also received this year's Ambassador's model, done on the Duende mold. The name is ¡Salud! and so far, we got two of the three colorways, leaving the last one to be revealed during BreyerFest.</p>
<center>
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/tg4RXsQG/B-EV-10472-Salud-Black-L-1024x1024.webp" width="400" height="400">
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/3wf8W3Y4/B-EV-10472-Salud-Grey-L-1024x1024.webp" width="400" height="400">
</center>
    <p>Out of these two, I like the black one the most as it reminds me of Oreo cookies.</p>
    <p>Speaking of Duende, the latest Exotic Destination release was a place in Spain called Mallorca. I have to admit that it is not my favourite and thus, I would not purchase it if selected, even though I see why many people love it.</p>
<center>

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/hPD5ZT9n/IMG_7690.jpg" width="400" height="400">
</center>
    <p>EDIT: I saw some in-person pictures, and I really like it. The images do not do justice to this model, unfortunately. The dapples look amazing, and I love how the mane and tail start a bit more gray on top and gradually turn black as they go down.</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>Regarding my show, I have been actively accepting more and more showers, and right now, there are over 60 entrants and 1,400 entries, which is incredible. The deadline is on the 7th of April, so make sure to enter before that so I have time to accept you.</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>Yesterday, it was April the 1st, and as always, Breyer had a fun surprise for us. They made Pal O' Mine into a model on the Nikolas mold! It is very cute and such a fun idea, and I believe it will end up being in the BreyerFest silent auction or even live? I guess we will have to see.</p>

    <p>EDIT: After writing this, Breyer announced that they would offer a model on the Nikolas mold with Pal O' Mine’s colors to three lucky winners of the draw. It will be free for the collectors who get it. They also showed another round of the April Fools Stablemates. I really like the Arabian Mare and Georgio!</p>

    <p>Peter Stone also did a very fun trick this year. They created a model with only horse heads! They said that this would be part of the DAH. The funniest thing is that they allowed one lucky and fast collector to actually buy this model and choose the colorway!</p>

    <p>For March, this is the sneak peek they sent out to collector members:</p>

    <p>This is the VIP swag pack this year. It's not my cup of tea. There is nothing that interests me except the little pins. What are those colors on these molds? Imagine if they have variations for the limited runs and Celebration Horse. Is there a blue variation of Get This Party Started? Because the markings match the real model!</p>

    <p>I also got my Online Traditional Access ticket today.</p>

    <p>Last but not least, the essay contest winners were announced, and the winner was Cash. This means that his model will be made into a Regular Run later this year.</p>

    <p>The runners-up were Thiarnain and Skip to My Lulu. I would suggest visiting www.breyerhorses.com/blogs/news/meet-the-2024-breyer-essay-contest-winners for more information on the three winners!</p>

    <p>In the last post, I mentioned the arrival of the most limited horse in my collection. It was stuck in customs, and it was released on Monday, meaning that I will have him tomorrow! Sunrise on the Reaping, on the other hand, had a delay, but I got it, and I really enjoy it. The lore of The Hunger Games is one of my favourite things, and it is very fun to learn more about it.</p>
    <p>Oof, this was a long post. I hope you liked reading it :)</p>
