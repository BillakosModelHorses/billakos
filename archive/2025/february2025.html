    <h3>Updates</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 28 February 2025</p>
    <p>Hello! I haven’t posted anything here for a while, even though I had some free time to do so. I guess I just wasn’t that motivated. However, I have been doing other things in my life, such as going out with my friends and having fun with my dogs. Another exciting thing for me is that I went skiing for the first time! At first, I took a one hour lesson, and then my friends took me to a slope. I was very scared, but I managed to go down with only four falls! It was extremely fun, and by the end of the day, I was actually doing great for my first time. I felt more confident and was able to turn much better. Two weeks later, we decided to go again, and last Wednesday, I was back on the slopes! This time, everything was much better. I had a lot more balance and control compared to the first time. The only downside was that at some point, there was mist, which made it even harder for me.</p>
    <p>Regarding model horses, I purchased a very limited edition horse from a seller on Facebook, but it hasn’t arrived yet. It was quite an expensive model, so I decided that if I got this one, I wouldn’t be buying any other models this year (except for the Celebration Horse and maybe Hats Off to You). I might still end up getting another model if it’s something I just can’t pass up, like an extremely beautiful Collector Club release.</p>
    <p>Moreover, I started making another medallion of a braided warmblood horse. It’s still in the very early stages:</p>

    <p>Last but not least, I really want to start a series of online model horse shows on omhps.com, and I might begin working on it very soon.</p>
    <p>As always, I hope you liked this post. Bye :)</p>

    <h3>Maddox is here but will he be here??</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 7 February 2025</p>
    <p>Hey everyone. Today, Breyer released Maddox, the first Collector Club special run for 2025. I have a few things to say about this model. I really like the dapple gray color, and this mold is spectacular. However, I decided not to get him for 4 reasons, which are the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>I would like to save the $180 that I would have to spend on Maddox ($90 + $55 for shipping + $35 for customs/import taxes). This will help me with my 2025 goals (1. Getting my first Artist Resin, 2. Acquiring a Connoisseur model, 3. Getting a Breyer with fewer than 100 pieces) as I will have more money to put into these models.</li>
    <li>This mold is very long and quite tippy, and right now, I don't have much space, so I wouldn't know where to put it.</li>
    <li>Even though I like this model, it's not something I absolutely must have. As I mentioned, I don’t have much space, and I want to limit my purchases this year to more exclusive and rarer pieces.</li>
    <li>The Breyer warehouse has been a mess in the last couple of months, and I wouldn’t like a random model surprise after waiting for a month for my Maddox.</li>
</ul>

    <p>I will say it again. I really can't understand what Breyer is thinking with the free domestic shipping. It’s harming international collectors. I have seen many people complaining in the comments about this issue. It is extremely unfair for a model to include the domestic shipping cost in its price while making international buyers pay even more. That was the reason why I didn’t join the Vintage Club, and unless I really love a model, I am probably not going to get it.</p>
    <p>Speaking of the Vintage Club, look at this cute release that is based on the Walter Farley series! Inferno comes with a really cute vintage blanket and a book!</p>

    <p>All in all, I am not getting Maddox unless I change my mind before he sells out/retire. I am finally free from my exams (which, unfortunately, did not end well) and can rest before the next semester starts! I hope you have a wonderful day :)</p>

    <h3>Crystal, Prague and new Schleich scale</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 5 February 2025</p>
    <p>Hello collectors. Today I will talk about some new Breyer models and I will show you some extremely exciting news about Schleich! First of all, this is the last remaining BreyerFest Limited Edition for this year, and it's, of course, the crystal model. They named it Standing Ovation, and it's the crystal version of the American Saddlebred mold. I like it, and it could be a great souvenir to remember this milestone for the company. I haven't yet decided what I am going to purchase this year, and I have to put a lot of thought into it because there are many exceptional models I like this year, and it will probably be very expensive...</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/W4WDBc7s/Standing-Ovation-R.webp" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>Next on the line is Prague (the latest addition to the Exotic Destination Series)! I have many things to say about this one. I love these series just because I love visiting other countries, and when I see a model that is made/named after a place I have been to, I really want it. That is the case with Prague, as I visited this town in December. It was extremely beautiful, and I think the model fits the theme quite a bit. The dapple gray coat looks very wintery, like snow, and Prague is one of the best Christmas destinations.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/NMqYnNrd/Prague-Bothsides-2048x2048.webp" width="800" height="400"></center>
    <p>Here are some photos I took while I was there!</p>

    <p>Besides the model, there was something else I wanted to talk about. I might sound negative, but there is something that needs to be done. When they opened the club subscriptions, they announced an increase in the models but with free DOMESTIC ONLY shipping. What about international buyers? We have to pay extra for the shipping, which is something I understand as it is more expensive, but the problem is that we pay the extra price that otherwise would be the domestic shipping. What I mean is that on top of the price increase (for the "free" shipping), we have to pay around 60-70 USD more! That is very unfair, and they did the same with the web special, and I am afraid they will do this with Collector Club models as well. I really want Breyer to do something about this because it is ridiculous to increase the price for international collectors with no bonus at all. I think this is bad for U.S. collectors as well, as they can't add a Stablemate in order to get a bigger box for their model since they would have to pay extra shipping.</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>Big news for Schleich! They are going to introduce a new horse collection in 1:12 scale. How amazing is that? They announced this at a toy exhibition in Germany, and modellpferdeversand.de shared this information with us on their blog. As they mentioned, the models are planned to come out late in 2025, and there is no information on the price yet. I believe they will be around 30 USD. These are the five horses they revealed there. My favorite is the braided warmblood on the left.</p>

    <p>Thank you for joining me on another blog post! I hope you enjoy the work I am doing here. Right now, I am very excited for many things, such as finishing my exams on Friday and planning some model horse related things that, if they go right, I will show them to you! :)</p>

    <h3>Seize the Day Surprise early prediction</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 3 February 2025</p>
    <p>Happy Monday! As we approach BreyerFest and many models have been revealed, I think it's time to show you which models are currently on my list and which molds have been eliminated for the Seize the Day Surprise. I won’t go through every mold because that would take forever, but I will make a list of the remaining ones. Here is an image with all of them:</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/nL0H0kh9/IMG-0530.jpg" width="1200" height="400"></center>
    <p>The ones marked in red have been eliminated for various reasons. For example, some are very old and unpopular, while others have been or will be released in 2025 as regular runs, special runs, limited editions, club models, etc.</p>
    <p>The remaining molds are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Anamar</li>
    <li>Andalusian Mare</li>
    <li>Ashquar</li>
    <li>Boomerang</li>
    <li>Bouncer</li>
    <li>Brighty</li>
    <li>Cantering Warmblood</li>
    <li>Vermeer</li>
    <li>Georg</li>
    <li>Goffret</li>
    <li>Gypsy Vanner</li>
    <li>Icelandic</li>
    <li>Kennebec Count</li>
    <li>Lipizzaner Mare</li>
    <li>Lipizzaner Stallion</li>
    <li>Marabella</li>
    <li>Mangalarga Marchador</li>
    <li>Marwari</li>
    <li>Missouri Fox Trotter</li>
    <li>Troubadour</li>
    <li>Mustang Mare</li>
    <li>Mustang Stallion</li>
    <li>Newsworthy</li>
    <li>Nokota</li>
    <li>Astrid</li>
    <li>Othello</li>
    <li>Paso Fino</li>
    <li>Peruvian Paso</li>
    <li>Rain</li>
    <li>Ruffian</li>
    <li>Shagya Arabian</li>
    <li>Shannondell</li>
    <li>Zafirah</li>
    <li>Duende</li>
    <li>Spirit</li>
    <li>Constantia</li>
    <li>Firefly</li>
    <li>Strapless</li>
    <li>Susecion</li>
    <li>Totilas</li>
    <li>Weather girl</li>
    <li>Valegro</li>
    <li>Vanner Mare</li>
    <li>Carrick</li>
    <li>Idocus</li>
    <li>Welsh Mare</li>
    <li>Wixom</li>
    <li>Zippo Pine Bar.</li>
</ul>
    <p>Some of these are very unlikely to be the surprise model, but I haven’t crossed them out yet. I don’t currently have a top 10, but there are specific molds that could be perfect for the Seize the Day Surprise. As Breyer reveals more models throughout the year, I will continue to remove molds from the list and update it. In the end, just before BreyerFest, I will share my final predictions! :)</p>
