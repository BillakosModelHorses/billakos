    <h3>More Breyerfest reveals so far</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 30 January 2025</p>
    <p>Hey! I have been very inactive lately, and I really want to change that. I will finish my exams on the 7th of February, and I will have more time for model horses! I am also thinking of hosting my first online model horse show for collectability. Regarding BreyerFest, they have revealed all the Special Runs. I will make a post with my ranking list.</p>
<center><h3><span style="color: #2c789c;">Limited Editions</span></h3></center>
    <p>This year's classic scale limited edition is a portrait horse! It's called "Game Day Surprise." I love this model, and I think the accessory is very cute!</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/8PQkr7pn/B-EV-10448-Game-Day-Surprise-with-Sash-R-1024x1024.webp" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>Beau N’ Arrow is another limited edition based on a vaulting horse. I can't wait to see him in the covered arena live with his squad!</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/T1mR4699/B-EV-10449-Beau-N-Arrow-R-1024x1024.webp" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>This is the Best of BreyerFest - Series 6 models! These models are based on the ones from BreyerFest 2015 Vive La France: Parfait, C’est Bon!, Truffles, Crème de la Crème, and Tout Suite.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/NjQgpZr6/B-EV-10462-Best-of-Breyer-Fest-Box-Silo-Web-448x360.webp" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>The little Fjord is the one I want the most. Unfortunately, I am not going to get this set as I have a limit on the money I am spending on Breyer's website, and I would prefer to get something else.</p>
<center><h3><span style="color: #2c789c;">In-Person Special Runs</span></h3></center>
    <p>Yolo is a weird name for a model, but here is a dapple gray Vanner. I like this one, but not as much as others and probably wouldn't choose it if I was going to Breyerfest in person.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/pLVHD8gk/YOLO-L-1024x1024.webp" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>"Life's a Journey" is this year's non-equine special run model! It's a Collie with a blue merle coat. I didn’t know what merle was until I got my real life dog earlier this year, which is merle.</p>
<center>
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/L5dSfWpZ/Lifes-A-Journey-L-1024x1024.webp" width="400" height="400">
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/RCf49v71/Lifes-A-Journey-R-1024x1024.webp" width="400" height="400">
</center>
    <p>The bandana is extremely cute, and I’m lowkey glad that it's not available online, as it would make the preference form even harder for me.</p>
<center><h3><span style="color: #2c789c;">In-Person / Online SR</span></h3></center>
    <p>To the Ties That Bind Us is the decorator special run, and I really like it! I love that they used the same pattern as the 75th Anniversary models with the silhouettes of the different molds. The blue color is really nice, and I am seriously considering putting it in my preference form.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/wjWdFMzz/To-the-Ties-That-Bind-Us-1024x1024.webp" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>This year's surprise model is called Seize the Day Surprise. I will post my current prediction list soon and update it regularly because there are a lot of possibilities right now.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Yq6rNtj2/111124-BF25-Seize-The-Day-Surprise-logo-final-KM-1024x1024.webp" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>The next special run is my favorite! Hats Off to You is the vintage model SR, and I am absolutely in love with it. I love this mold, and the color is amazing. It comes with two hats: a regular western hat and a PARTY HAT!!! How amazing is that?</p>
<center>
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/xCNYX2W2/Hats-Off-R-1024x1024.webp" width="400" height="400">
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Xvz4NJ1L/Hats-off-Party-L-1024x1024.webp" width="400" height="400">
</center>
    <p>This will be my top choice for sure.</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>Last but not least, we got a model on the Criollo mold. Future is Bright is a beautiful palomino with a lot of dapples! I really like this version with the long mane.</p>
<center>

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/1ztyZ6B4/Future-is-Bright-R-1024x1024.webp" width="400" height="400">
</center>
<center><h3><span style="color: #2c789c;">Online Limited Editions</span></h3></center>
    <p>Hooplah is this year's online traditional model. I really like this model, and I might add it to my cart. I hope there will be a matte/glossy split on this one, as I really want it in glossy.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/bNh8w4g7/Hoopla-L-1024x1024.webp" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>The online exclusive stablemate that I will definitely get is Shindig. I am not in love with the color, but I quite like it. I am sure that there will be a fun variation on this one.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/TYJxLQHp/Shindig-R-1024x1024.webp" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>While writing this, they revealed the plush. Meet Party Pal!</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/wxsTvXpm/B-EV-10455-Party-pals-1024x1024.webp" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>I believe that there will be micro runs of 75 pieces for many of the models. I hope you enjoyed today’s post, and again, I am very sorry for my inactivity. After my exams, I will definitely be more active. Have a nice evening :)</p>

    <h3>Breyerfest reveals so far</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 13 January 2025</p>
<center><h3><span style="color: #2c789c;">Event Stablemates</span></h3></center>
    <p>This year, I love all the stablemates. If I had to put them in order, I would say:</p>
<ul>
    <li>1. Bellini</li>
    <li>2. Cava</li>
    <li>3. Prosecco</li>
    <li>4. Mimosa</li>
</ul>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/PfphJQmk/B-EV-10460-Break-Out-the-Bubbles-box-1024x1024.webp" width="600" height="400"></center>
    <p>I will definitely search for the polo pony (Bellini) and maybe Cava. These names are very fun and fit the theme very well! I also love that they did realistic colors this time as I did not like last year's stablemates</p>
<center><h3><span style="color: #2c789c;">Limited Editions</span></h3></center>
    <p>Belesema Sapphire is the first portrait model of a horse that Breyer revealed. It's a chestnut mare.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/w38wjpD3/B-EV-10447-Belesema-Sapphire-R-1024x1024.webp" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>I am not sure, but I might purchase her. I really like this mold, and I believe that there might be a variation with all 3 versions of it.</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>Halcyonia Night Life is the second LE. To be honest, this model doesn't excite me. I am not a huge fan of black models as I find them a bit boring. In the images, there are some dapples, which is nice, but still, I don't see this model and say wow.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/WzJ9V3FQ/B-EV-10445-Halcyonia-Night-Life-L-1024x1024.webp" width="400" height="400"></center>
<center><h3><span style="color: #2c789c;">In-Person Special Runs</span></h3></center>
    <p>The reveal party started with "Get This Party Started"! This pinto Connemara is only available to in-person attendees, but I don't mind it as it is not my cup of tea. It's a beautiful model but not something I would want to purchase.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/fbBqj1Qg/Get-This-Party-Started-R-1024x1024.webp" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>Nothing I said about the previous model applies to this one. We got the mare and foal set "Good Times and Great Friends," and unfortunately, it is only available in person. This set is amazing, and when I saw the images, I got very excited—until I saw the availability.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/85cKyw1k/Good-Times-Great-Friends-1024x1024.webp" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>I am thinking of not getting anything during BreyerFest weekend and try for this set in the second-chance sale. I might get lucky and snag one. The gloss is amazing, and I would gladly pair them with Bolero to make a cute family.</p>
<center><h3><span style="color: #2c789c;">In-Person / Online SR</span></h3></center>
    <p>The only online-available special run we have seen so far is "Let the Good Times Roll". It's a sooty buckskin leopard Appaloosa on the Show Jumping Warmblood mold. I really like this model, and I might include it in the top of my preference list.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/sXLnbSXY/Let-the-Good-Times-Roll-L-1024x1024.webp" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>For this Special Run there could be a loose/braided mane and tail split on this one or matte/glossy split (or even both).</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>I believe that this year they will do many fun surprises with the models. There will most probably be micro runs and some very exciting variations. Breyer will continue to reveal more models in the upcoming weeks, and I will mention them here. Thank you for reading today's posts. Have a great week :)</p>

    <h3>Dogs, PC and Midas!</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 13 January 2025</p>
    <p>Happy Monday! I haven't been that active lately regarding model horses because there are many things happening in my life. First of all, I got 2 puppies! My mum wanted a poodle, but I wanted a Dachshund, and we got both of them. They are very cute, but I have to watch them and take care of them. I named mine Pretzel, and here she is:</p>

</center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>Something I wanted to talk about but did not have the time for is the Premier Club. I was thinking of joining but decided not to in the end. This lineup is amazing, and I love all 3 models. The thing I like the most is the choice of braided/loose on Rowan and the matte/glossy choice on Cosimo. Moreover, the chance to get the micro-run gray Winnifred made me think about it a bit more.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/L84bD672/IMG-2158.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>I finally found one of my top grails in Europe! I finally got Midas and I can't wait for him to arrive. I have been looking for one but did not want to spend a lot on shipping fees and customs. I also did not want to spend much money on models right now but when I saw Midas on eBay, I couldn't let him pass. The price was very reasonable too.</p>
    <p>I will talk about the BreyerFest reveals we have in the next post (I already posted it)...</p>

    <h3>Christmas haul 2024</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 5 January 2025</p>
    <p>Hello! Today, I’ll show you everything I got for Christmas! Some of these are models I purchased myself, while others were gifts from my family.</p>
    <p>First of all, I finally got the Stablemate wooden display barn! I chose the older version with the white and blue colors. Instead of getting an advent calendar this year, I decided to open one horse every weekend in December. On the 24th, I opened the display barn! I love the Stablemates, but my favorite is this bay Valegro!</p>

</center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>Next on the list is the polo pony! I finally found one at an amazing price. I opened this model on Christmas Day instead of New Year’s, which is when we usually exchange gifts.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/KvC0H1CZ/B06648-B8-88-B9-41-E6-BB2-E-A3-B64-D27-D1-BA.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>The next horse is this Peter Stone MiniMe Blue Granite in Glossy, which is from the Equilocity event of 2006 and I think there were 50 made.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/8c0ZDc5m/AA1-ED9-F0-6-EFC-43-CC-805-A-8847-D31-D9-EEA.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>Moving on, I got Ivy! I’ve wanted this model for a very long time, and when a seller from Germany listed one, I snagged it as fast as I could!</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/sXKn6wC8/ADA7874-E-89-CE-4354-9-CE3-6-C755-A7-EED1-E.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>Check out this amazing porcelain model that my cousin got for me in Vienna! She visited the Spanish Riding School shop just for me and picked out this stunning statue/model. It’s now proudly displayed in my model cabinet as it’s such a special piece in my collection.</p>
<center>

</center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>This year, my parents gave me Zafirah for the holidays, and I couldn’t be happier. It’s such a handsome model with incredible details. The face is especially cute!</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/J0np9Z1h/68-AD5753-487-F-4-B20-ADF3-BEF94-A25146-B.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>

</center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>Last but not least, I finally unboxed Calista! I ordered her back in September but decided to open her on my name day (January 1st).</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/FHJBry0d/99-ADE5-C1-4-DA6-4-D24-AD94-9-F77-A6-F81-FAB.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>I hope you enjoyed my haul! I’ll talk more about each model in a future collection showcase. Have an amazing day :)</p>
