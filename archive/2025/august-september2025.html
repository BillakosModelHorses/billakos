    <h3>1 year Anniversary!</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 4 September 2025</p>
    <p>Billakos Model Horses was published one year ago! What started as a simple passion project quickly grew into something more. My original goal was to create a model horse related blog where I could share my plans, experiences, and ideas with others. At the same time, I wanted it to serve as a personal archive, more like a place where I could look back and see what I created and when, or even track when Breyer released certain models.</p>
    <p>Over time, this little project evolved. I added new pages like the chat and the shows, and my favorite addition was definitely the mini game I built. It was such a joy to see people actually play it and share how many models they managed to catch!</p>
    <p>Even though the blog didn’t grow as big as I had first hoped, it still found a small but meaningful audience. People left comments, sent messages to the chat, and showed genuine interest in what I was offering. That connection made the whole project worth it.</p>

    <p>I can’t wait to see what the next year will bring! :)</p>

    <h3>BreyerFest Haul 2025</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 31 August 2025</p>
    <p>Hello! Last year I started my blog with a similar post where I showed you my BreyerFest 2024 haul. This year I’ll include models that I got during this year's BreyerFest as well as models I purchased after the event.</p>
    <p>Of course, I’m going to start with the celebration horse Tight Lanes aka Phish. This was the only model I opened before leaving for vacation. Usually, I don’t get to open my models until late August or early September, but he arrived in Greece and cleared customs very quickly.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/FKFwNbnR/IMG-5457.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>I have to admit that I liked him in person a lot more than I thought I would. This was a new mold for my collection. It is very nice, but a bit long for the shelves! The blanket is amazing, and it feels like such a special souvenir for this anniversary.</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>Now, I’ll show you the models I got from Breyer during the event weekend. I got to open these models on Thursday. My parents went to the post office and picked them up for me 3–5 days after I left for vacation. I was really curious to know which variations I would get and now I finally do.</p>
    <p>The first model is Hats Off to You! This was the Special Run that I DEFINITELY wanted. I always wanted a model on this mold, and this color is phenomenal. I also loved that he came with two hats!</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/zD9mKg3t/IMG-5453.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>I am in love with the Old Timer mold, and the fact that this model has the little 7 and 5 hidden in the face markings is very cool.</p>
    <p>I also grabbed Hoopla because I saw him in the live broadcast and really liked him. What I hadn’t noticed was the white that extends on his tail.This small detail makes a big difference to me!</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/htBH3RLV/IMG-5451.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>I was hoping for a glossy version but didn’t get one. Still, mine has really nice dapples, which I am happy with!</p>
    <p>The last model I grabbed from the BreyerFest store was the surprise model. This year, I liked all the variations except the decorator. I would have been happy with any color, but even happier with a glossy one. I ended up getting the least limited version, which was a bit disappointing. However, I really, really like this model. The coat is gorgeous, and I’m extremely happy with him.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/BnBRr7pk/IMG-5448.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>A week after BreyerFest, I went to a store near my house that had some Breyer Stablemates from 2009–2010, and I found Elvis and Rising Sun: Harmony on Horseback resin model.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/tgrwT1Lz/IMG-5460.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>I was in shock because it was so unexpected to find a piece like this here in Greece. The box included the COA, and the fact that the base has a little sol key is such a nice touch. I always wanted a Breyer Gallery piece for my collection, and I got one unexpectedly!</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>Last but not least, when Salzburg was released, the early holiday sale was happening. The fact that I got picked for my first-ever web special and that the Stablemate I really wanted "Nero" was available in the shop meant I had to get both. It was such a fun “spotty pony mail”! Salzburg is very chunky and beautiful.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/nc7ykhDH/IMG-5455.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>Nero is incredible! I love his face markings, and he weighs a lot more than I expected. I’ve always admired leopard Appaloosa horses, and now he and Salzburg can join Brahms in my herd!</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Qxk6C97W/IMG-5377.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>With this order, I also purchased the three Just About Horses magazines that were available on Breyer’s website. One of the three was really low in stock (only two or three left) so I grabbed them all together.</p>

    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>All in all, this was my BreyerFest haul for this year. I wasn’t planning on purchasing more than two models (my two Special Runs from BreyerFest), but oh well… I’m happy with my models. I hope you enjoyed my BF haul :)</p>

    <h3>Collection Showcase #8</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 16 August 2025</p>
    <p>Hello! I haven't posted a collection showcase in a very long time and I really don't know why... I decided to come back with a very special model of mine which is of course Midas! This amazing piece was released in 2021 as a lottery model for Collector Club members. The model number is #712418 and there were only 250 pieces made, making him quite limited.</p>
    <p>For me, he was my top holy grail for a long time, and even though there are many on the US market, I wanted to find one in Europe because I didn't want to pay $700–800 (including the shipping fee and customs). There was one for sale at some point in a German store, but he was quickly bought. The price of that one became the price range for my future searches. In January of this year, an eBay seller listed him at a better price than my range, and without a second thought I got him!</p>

</center>
    <p>He is a really nice copy, and I love all the mapping and details he has. Something that makes him even more special is that he was hand-painted at Breyer’s New Jersey facility by the same artisans who create the BreyerFest raffle and auction models as well as other very limited pieces.</p>
    <p>This is by far one of the prettiest horses in my collection, and I believe he is also highly desirable among collectors. I hope you liked this Collection Showcase :)</p>

    <h3>1st Model Horse Show - Concluded</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 12 August 2025</p>
    <p>I’m very happy to announce that the 1st BMH Model Horse Show has officially concluded! You can check the results on the Model Horse Shows page that has a clickable image that directs you to the omhps show page.</p>

<a href="https://billakosmodelhorses.com/shows/modelhorseshows">Model Horse Shows page</a>
    
    <p>Once again, I’m sorry it took so long for me to finish judging. A lot has happened over the past few months, but I finally found the time to work through the show. It was a very fun experience, and it taught me a lot.</p>
    <p>For future shows I host, one thing I’d like to change is the class sizes. Allowing fewer horses in each class would make it easier for me to judge more carefully.</p>
    <p>I also really enjoyed seeing the collectability information included in some entries. I especially valued details like run number, thwe way it was released and when, model ID, etc. Models with this kind of information placed higher because it showed me that the owner really put care into their entry, which is something I really appreciated.</p>

    <p>Thank you to everyone who entered my very first model horse show! :)</p>
