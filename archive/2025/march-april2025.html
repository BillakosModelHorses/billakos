    <h3>Collector Club store, Rambler and sneak peak</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 27 April 2025</p>
    <p>Hey guys! When Breyer announced the 2025 Collector Club, they mentioned that they would make an exclusive store just for the members. After that, we heard nothing about it and it made me believe that they would just cancel this plan. However, one or two weeks ago, they opened this store and it featured some club exclusive models such as Troubadour, Shelby, Santino and some more that you can see in the image down below. Moreover, they made Collector Club merchandise with a tumbler, a pin and a bag. This is very interesting for me as I am really curious to see what models they will put in and if they will announce it or put them at random times.</p>

    <p>In the past week, they also showed us this year's classic scale gambler’s choice and I have to admit that I LOVE every single variation of it. This mold is amazing. The limit per member is 3 instead of 1, which I think is great for international collectors like me, as they can save a lot on shipping if they want more than one model!</p>

    <p>I really want one of these horses and I am still thinking of getting 1 Santino from the CC store, 1 Rambler, and 1 CC pin but I am not sure yet. I will think about it for a bit.</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>This is the sneak peek for April that Breyer sent to the newsletter:</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/T3CWjkD8/mail.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>There are many speculations regarding this model. They said that this is for CC members, but it could be anything from a special run (which I highly doubt as we got Rambler this month), a web special or even this year's CC Appreciation event because this is a glossy model. I guess we will have to see.</p>
    <p>Before closing this post, I wanted to inform you that I moved the Paddock Chat and you can now find it in the main menu on every page. I moved the Archive page to the Horseshoe menu and it is now accessible from this page (Stable Stories) on the top. Have a wonderful day :)</p>

    <h3>News</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 2 April 2025</p>
    <p>Hello! I have been quite absent in the previous weeks, and there are a lot of things to cover. Starting off with BreyerMidwest that was held on the 28th-30th of March, we saw in person a lot of the BreyerFest Special Runs and limited editions. My favourites were Hats Off to You and this year's online exclusive Hoopla! Volunteers also received this year's Ambassador's model, done on the Duende mold. The name is ¡Salud! and so far, we got two of the three colorways, leaving the last one to be revealed during BreyerFest.</p>
<center>

</center>
    <p>Out of these two, I like the black one the most as it reminds me of Oreo cookies.</p>
    <p>Speaking of Duende, the latest Exotic Destination release was a place in Spain called Mallorca. I have to admit that it is not my favourite and thus, I would not purchase it if selected, even though I see why many people love it.</p>

</center>
    <p>EDIT: I saw some in-person pictures, and I really like it. The images do not do justice to this model, unfortunately. The dapples look amazing, and I love how the mane and tail start a bit more gray on top and gradually turn black as they go down.</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>Regarding my show, I have been actively accepting more and more showers, and right now, there are over 60 entrants and 1,400 entries, which is incredible. The deadline is on the 7th of April, so make sure to enter before that so I have time to accept you.</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>Yesterday, it was April the 1st, and as always, Breyer had a fun surprise for us. They made Pal O' Mine into a model on the Nikolas mold! It is very cute and such a fun idea, and I believe it will end up being in the BreyerFest silent auction or even live? I guess we will have to see.</p>

</center>
    <p>EDIT: After writing this, Breyer announced that they would offer a model on the Nikolas mold with Pal O' Mine’s colors to three lucky winners of the draw. It will be free for the collectors who get it. They also showed another round of the April Fools Stablemates. I really like the Arabian Mare and Georgio!</p>

    <p>Peter Stone also did a very fun trick this year. They created a model with only horse heads! They said that this would be part of the DAH. The funniest thing is that they allowed one lucky and fast collector to actually buy this model and choose the colorway!</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Vk5HmwGH/IMG_7702.webp" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>For March, this is the sneak peek they sent out to collector members:</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/9FsywjXk/IMG_7711.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>This is the VIP swag pack this year. It's not my cup of tea. There is nothing that interests me except the little pins. What are those colors on these molds? Imagine if they have variations for the limited runs and Celebration Horse. Is there a blue variation of Get This Party Started? Because the markings match the real model!</p>

    <p>I also got my Online Traditional Access ticket today.</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>The second release for the Vintage Club is now on sale, and it is this beautiful blue pinto pair.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/4yJBMRHP/IMG_2928.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>Last but not least, the essay contest winners were announced, and the winner was Cash. This means that his model will be made into a Regular Run later this year.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/HWqwv7Fx/cash-model-1024x1024.webp" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>The runners-up were Thiarnain and Skip to My Lulu. I would suggest visiting www.breyerhorses.com/blogs/news/meet-the-2024-breyer-essay-contest-winners for more information on the three winners!</p>

    <p>In the last post, I mentioned the arrival of the most limited horse in my collection. It was stuck in customs, and it was released on Monday, meaning that I will have him tomorrow! Sunrise on the Reaping, on the other hand, had a delay, but I got it, and I really enjoy it. The lore of The Hunger Games is one of my favourite things, and it is very fun to learn more about it.</p>
    <p>Oof, this was a long post. I hope you liked reading it :)</p>

    <h3>BreyerMidwest, BF tickets, show & book</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 18 March 2025</p>
    <p>Hello! Today I will talk about many things I have on my mind! First of all, BreyerMidwest is this weekend, which is very exciting because we will see some BreyerFest special runs and limited editions in person. Of course, for people who are lucky to be there in Kansas, this is not the most exciting part, but for me, it is (I just realised that we will also see the volunteer model for 2025!). Moreover, BreyerFest tickets will go on sale tomorrow. There is a discounted price until 30 of April, so don't forget to get yours before that.</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>Stormy Strike made a tier list for all the BF models, and this is how I ranked them. Hats off to you, definitely in the special category with the cute Fjord stablemate.</p>

    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>Last week I posted my Online Model Horse Show, and so far, there are more than 40 showers and 900 entries, which is very exciting. I took a peek at the OOAK classes, and there were 2 entries so far. The one I saw was a horse I didn't know existed, but it is a very cool blank ASB foal that was supposed to be flockie rocking model, meaning that there is no mane/tail. If you haven't seen the show, the deadline to enter is April 9th.</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>The most limited horse I have ever had is currently in customs, and I can't wait for it to come. I will definitely show it to you once it arrives. It will probably be out in 3-4 days, and I was thinking of opening it on my birthday, which is on March 29th. I don't believe I will be able to wait, but who knows.</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>Tomorrow is also a great day because the new Hunger Games book will be released! I have already preordered it, and I will have it in my hands in just a few hours (it's almost midnight right now).</p>
    <p>I hope you have a wonderful day :)</p>

    <h3>Sneak Peak: February</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 1 March 2025</p>
    <p>Hi everyone! Yesterday, Breyer sent out the monthly newsletter to Collector Club members, which included a sneak peek of the model that will be offered to members in March. Here is the image:</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/15hLCBJ7/IMG_7666.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>This one reminds me of sand. I’m guessing that it will be the next model in the Exotic Destinations series and will represent a city or country well known for its beaches or a popular summer travel destination.</p>
    <p>Have a great day :)</p>
