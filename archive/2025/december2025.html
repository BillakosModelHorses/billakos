    <h3>My top 5 purchases (2025)</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 28 December 2025</p>
    <p>Hello! Today I’ll be showing you my Top 5 purchases of 2025. This year, the selection isn’t very large, but the models I chose are definitely rarer and more expensive. You’ve probably seen most of them in previous posts, but it’s time to rank them, which is going to be hard, because they’re all amazing!</p>
    <p>My top model has to be Midas. He was my holy grail for a very long time. I absolutely love the color, and the mold itself is stunning.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/XvHVDK2H/IMG_2238.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>Second on the list is definitely my OOAK glossy Braided Rowan. I’m incredibly happy and grateful to own such an amazing and irreplaceable model. It’s truly one of a kind.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/FHnnTPxh/IMG_6667.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>In third place, I chose Win, Place or Show. I don’t think I’ve shown him on the blog yet. I acquired him in March, and he’s a beautiful model. He was a diorama prize model, and I’ll be sharing more details about him in a future Collection Showcase post.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/85J6PgsK/IMG_3015.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>Next on the list is Ivy. I technically got this model last year, but she arrived on December 31st, after I had already posted my Top 5 purchases. I really wanted to include her here, as she’s one of my absolute Christmas favorites.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/sXKn6wC8/ADA7874E-89CE-4354-9CE3-6C755A7EED1E.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>Choosing the last spot is always the hardest, because there are several models I’d love to include. However, I have to say that the 75th Anniversary Deluxe Collector Club set was a fantastic addition to my collection. These two Stablemates are beautiful, and since the semi rearing Mustang is one of my favorite molds, they earned extra points for being small and adorable!</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/zGcP8cVZ/IMG_6556.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>An honorable mention goes to Nero, the Stablemate. He was such a pleasant surprise, as I never expected to own him. I usually don’t like spending much money on Stablemates, but since I got him directly from Breyer (with the exact cost and combined shipping along with Salzburg), I’m extremely happy. I love leopard Appaloosas especially on draft horses!</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Qxk6C97W/IMG_5377.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>I hope you enjoyed my Top 5 models of 2025. See you next year :)</p>

    <h3>Christmas Artwork</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 24 December 2025</p>
    <p>Tomorrow is Christmas Day, and since 2022 I’ve been creating a Christmas themed artwork each year. Last year, I actually posted the 2022 piece because the 2024 artwork wasn’t ready yet. Today, however, I’ll be showing you the 2022, 2023, and 2024 pieces in order. I’ve already shared two of the three somewhere on the blog.</p>
    <p>For 2022, I created a cute little Fjord horse walking through a snowy landscape. This piece was a lot of fun to make. I ended up using it for the blog in 2024 and simply changed the date in the corner.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/sgftYNTL/Untitled569_20251218013837.png" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>In 2023, I used the outline from a 3D model I made that year for my Christmas card. You can find the “Summer Horse” in the post I made on 15 November 2024. It’s funny how a summer horse ended up in a winter scene with snow! This artwork was really enjoyable to create, and I was very happy to include my first somewhat decent 3D model in a Christmas piece.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/vZPC3tKX/Untitled652_20251224134748.png" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>Last but not least, in 2024, I didn’t make a painting. Instead, I created a medallion. You’ve probably already seen this one. It works like a puzzle, as you can separate the horse from the “2024” plate. The design features a cute Fjord horse wearing a rug, while the extra plate includes a little snowman and a tiny tree. I really like that in 2024 I tried something different.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/P5fBWRSV/IMG_8055.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>As for 2025, you’ll have to wait until tomorrow to see what it is! All I can say for now is that it’s a digital painting similar to the 2022 and 2023. Maybe I should make a medallion as well… or perhaps next year I’ll do both!</p>
    <p>See you tomorrow :)</p>

    <h3>Trip, Clubs etc.</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 18 December 2025</p>
    <p>Hello! I’m back from my trip to South America! I visited many places, and it was truly an amazing experience. I went to the Amazon Rainforest, Machu Picchu (now I need the model), Rainbow Mountain, Death Road in Bolivia, and many, many more places. It was an unforgettable journey, but I’m also quite glad it’s over, as it was very exhausting.</p>

</center>
    <p>Everything was beautiful. I saw llamas, alpacas, and so many incredible landscapes. My top 5 experiences were:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The wrestling ladies in Bolivia (a local show where two women in traditional clothing “fake” fight each other)</li>
    <li>Machu Picchu</li>
    <li>The Nazca Desert with the famous symbols, as well as the nearby desert with an oasis</li>
    <li>Rainbow Mountain, which was stunning but very challenging, as we were walking at 5,000 meters above sea level</li>
    <li>and lastly the Death Road in Bolivia</li>
</ul>
    <p>This was an 18 day trip, and while I was in Lima, I decided to check Facebook Marketplace to see if there were any Breyer horses available in Peru. I actually found one very close to where I was staying! I contacted the seller, and he was kind enough to bring it directly to my hotel. It’s nothing particularly special, but it’s a lovely souvenir for my collection and a great reminder of this trip.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/PxzMnSYN/IMG_9611.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>I took this photo in the hotel room to send to a friend. It’s the bay running foal, and I believe it dates back to the 1970s.</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>Moreover, I wanted to share this really cool model I discovered that I didn’t even know existed. It’s the 2024 Stablemates Club model Lanin, but with a long mane instead of the roached mane from the official release. I didn’t know about this variation until AshleyInspirations posted it on the Breyer CC forums. This model was sold at BreyerFest as a test piece in a silent auction at the Collector Club tent.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/qqjY12dm/npumxwazkrt0vrcsbaue.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>Speaking of the Collector Club, I still haven’t purchased my 2026 membership, but I will very soon. I’m waiting for a less exciting day so I can make it special. I absolutely love Lavinia, the first release. I don’t think I’ll be joining any other clubs.</p>
    <p>The Vintage Club sold out yesterday. It took so long that Breyer ended up revealing at least three releases instead of just one. One possible reason is that members no longer keep their assigned COA numbers like they used to, which may have discouraged some collectors. For example, if I had COA number 1 for years and suddenly lost it, I’d be pretty frustrated too. That said, I really like the lamp and foal, the teased circus Stablemate with the traditional fighting stallion, which looks fun.</p>

</center>
    <p>The Premier Club also looks nice, but the rearing Andalusian isn’t really my cup of tea. It’s a transfer from a resin sculpt (originally made around 2005–2006, I believe) to plastic, with some changes as the sculptor has confirmed. My opinion on the Stablemates remains the same as always: some are nice, some less so, and some are really cool. The new bucking mold looks very promising, but we still need to see the color.</p>

    <p>Before posting this, Breyer also revealed the Holiday Surprise model, which turned out to be Merry Dancer. If you check my post from July 31st, you’ll see one leaked pink version that was taken out of the factory and sold on a Chinese website. The person who owned that model also mentioned a black and white (charcoal) version and a purple and white one, meaning the official surprise ended up being the green version. I have to admit, they don’t really remind me of the Northern Lights as much. They feel more like Easter models to me. The only version I truly like is the black one and, to a lesser extent, the green one, so I won’t be getting one this year. I mean what are the chances of getting the charcoal...</p>

    <p>Additionally, a sketch for the third Premier Club model has been revealed, and it’s a Shetland pony! This is very exciting, and I can’t wait to see the final color. A leopard Appaloosa would be incredible. With this reveal, we now know the full Premier Club lineup, but it’s still a pass for me. I don’t want the pressure of committing to every release. I’m sure there will be some surprises later on, just like last year.</p>

    <p>Thank you so much for reading today’s post. I have a few more posts planned before the end of the year, so stay tuned! One of them will be my Top 5 purchases of the year :)</p>
