    <h3>1 year Anniversary!</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 4 September 2025</p>
    <p>Billakos Model Horses was published one year ago! What started as a simple passion project quickly grew into something more. My original goal was to create a model horse related blog where I could share my plans, experiences, and ideas with others. At the same time, I wanted it to serve as a personal archive, more like a place where I could look back and see what I created and when, or even track when Breyer released certain models.</p>
    <p>Over time, this little project evolved. I added new pages like the chat and the shows, and my favorite addition was definitely the mini game I built. It was such a joy to see people actually play it and share how many models they managed to catch!</p>
    <p>Even though the blog didn’t grow as big as I had first hoped, it still found a small but meaningful audience. People left comments, sent messages to the chat, and showed genuine interest in what I was offering. That connection made the whole project worth it.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/765jpqbZ/IMG-5399.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>I can’t wait to see what the next year will bring! :)</p>

    <h3>BreyerFest Haul 2025</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 31 August 2025</p>
    <p>Hello! Last year I started my blog with a similar post where I showed you my BreyerFest 2024 haul. This year I’ll include models that I got during this year's BreyerFest as well as models I purchased after the event.</p>
    <p>Of course, I’m going to start with the celebration horse Tight Lanes aka Phish. This was the only model I opened before leaving for vacation. Usually, I don’t get to open my models until late August or early September, but he arrived in Greece and cleared customs very quickly.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/FKFwNbnR/IMG-5457.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>I have to admit that I liked him in person a lot more than I thought I would. This was a new mold for my collection. It is very nice, but a bit long for the shelves! The blanket is amazing, and it feels like such a special souvenir for this anniversary.</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>Now, I’ll show you the models I got from Breyer during the event weekend. I got to open these models on Thursday. My parents went to the post office and picked them up for me 3–5 days after I left for vacation. I was really curious to know which variations I would get and now I finally do.</p>
    <p>The first model is Hats Off to You! This was the Special Run that I DEFINITELY wanted. I always wanted a model on this mold, and this color is phenomenal. I also loved that he came with two hats!</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/zD9mKg3t/IMG-5453.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>I am in love with the Old Timer mold, and the fact that this model has the little 7 and 5 hidden in the face markings is very cool.</p>
    <p>I also grabbed Hoopla because I saw him in the live broadcast and really liked him. What I hadn’t noticed was the white that extends on his tail.This small detail makes a big difference to me!</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/htBH3RLV/IMG-5451.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>I was hoping for a glossy version but didn’t get one. Still, mine has really nice dapples, which I am happy with!</p>
    <p>The last model I grabbed from the BreyerFest store was the surprise model. This year, I liked all the variations except the decorator. I would have been happy with any color, but even happier with a glossy one. I ended up getting the least limited version, which was a bit disappointing. However, I really, really like this model. The coat is gorgeous, and I’m extremely happy with him.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/BnBRr7pk/IMG-5448.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>A week after BreyerFest, I went to a store near my house that had some Breyer Stablemates from 2009–2010, and I found Elvis and Rising Sun: Harmony on Horseback resin model.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/tgrwT1Lz/IMG-5460.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>I was in shock because it was so unexpected to find a piece like this here in Greece. The box included the COA, and the fact that the base has a little sol key is such a nice touch. I always wanted a Breyer Gallery piece for my collection, and I got one unexpectedly!</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>Last but not least, when Salzburg was released, the early holiday sale was happening. The fact that I got picked for my first-ever web special and that the Stablemate I really wanted "Nero" was available in the shop meant I had to get both. It was such a fun “spotty pony mail”! Salzburg is very chunky and beautiful.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/nc7ykhDH/IMG-5455.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>Nero is incredible! I love his face markings, and he weighs a lot more than I expected. I’ve always admired leopard Appaloosa horses, and now he and Salzburg can join Brahms in my herd!</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Qxk6C97W/IMG-5377.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>With this order, I also purchased the three Just About Horses magazines that were available on Breyer’s website. One of the three was really low in stock (only two or three left) so I grabbed them all together.</p>

</center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>All in all, this was my BreyerFest haul for this year. I wasn’t planning on purchasing more than two models (my two Special Runs from BreyerFest), but oh well… I’m happy with my models. I hope you enjoyed my BF haul :)</p>

    <h3>Collection Showcase #8</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 16 August 2025</p>
    <p>Hello! I haven't posted a collection showcase in a very long time and I really don't know why... I decided to come back with a very special model of mine which is of course Midas! This amazing piece was released in 2021 as a lottery model for Collector Club members. The model number is #712418 and there were only 250 pieces made, making him quite limited.</p>
    <p>For me, he was my top holy grail for a long time, and even though there are many on the US market, I wanted to find one in Europe because I didn't want to pay $700–800 (including the shipping fee and customs). There was one for sale at some point in a German store, but he was quickly bought. The price of that one became the price range for my future searches. In January of this year, an eBay seller listed him at a better price than my range, and without a second thought I got him!</p>

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/LXJHdqwH/IMG-2236.jpg" width="250" height="400">
</center>
    <p>He is a really nice copy, and I love all the mapping and details he has. Something that makes him even more special is that he was hand-painted at Breyer’s New Jersey facility by the same artisans who create the BreyerFest raffle and auction models as well as other very limited pieces.</p>
    <p>This is by far one of the prettiest horses in my collection, and I believe he is also highly desirable among collectors. I hope you liked this Collection Showcase :)</p>

    <h3>1st Model Horse Show - Concluded</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 12 August 2025</p>
    <p>I’m very happy to announce that the 1st BMH Model Horse Show has officially concluded! You can check the results on the Model Horse Shows page that has a clickable image that directs you to the omhps show page.</p>

<a href="https://billakosmodelhorses.com/shows/modelhorseshows">Model Horse Shows page</a>
    
    <p>Once again, I’m sorry it took so long for me to finish judging. A lot has happened over the past few months, but I finally found the time to work through the show. It was a very fun experience, and it taught me a lot.</p>
    <p>For future shows I host, one thing I’d like to change is the class sizes. Allowing fewer horses in each class would make it easier for me to judge more carefully.</p>
    <p>I also really enjoyed seeing the collectability information included in some entries. I especially valued details like run number, thwe way it was released and when, model ID, etc. Models with this kind of information placed higher because it showed me that the owner really put care into their entry, which is something I really appreciated.</p>

    <h3>Salzburg, SR numbers, sale and model spoilers</h3>
     <p class="date">Published on 31 July 2025</p>
    <p>Hey! In the last two weeks, there have been quite a few updates from Breyer! The special run and surprise model numbers got revealed, there’s a new web special, an early holiday sale with exclusive models for CC members, the monthly sneak peek, and lastly someone I wanted to talk about!</p>
    <p>Starting off with the special run numbers, I wasn’t too surprised by the 75 piece runs until I saw Shindig!! How cool was that? It’s also crazy to see people paying over $2200 for one. Hoopla had an interesting split too, with only 25% of them being glossy.</p>
    <p>As for the surprise model, the numbers weren’t too shocking:</p>
    <p>-Matte Silver Bay – 1150 pieces</p>
    <p>-Matte Blue Roan – 1625 pieces</p>
    <p>-Matte Dapple Grey - 965 pieces</p>
    <p>-Matte Flaxen Liver Chestnut – 1020 pieces</p>
    <p>-Matte Palomino Tobiano – 870 pieces</p>
    <p>-Glossy Silver Bay – 384 pieces</p>
    <p>-Glossy Dapple Grey – 384 pieces</p>
    <p>-Glossy Flaxen Liver Chestnut - 384 pieces</p>
    <p>-Glossy Palomino Tobiano - 384 pieces</p>
    <p>-Glossy Decorator - 634 pieces</p>
    <p>My order hasn’t arrived yet, but it should get here next week, though I’ll be on vacation until August 27th, so I’ll have to wait to open it. I’m really hoping for the Glossy Palomino Tobiano, but honestly, I’ll be happy with anything except the decorator (which I’d probably try to trade).</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
          <p>Next, about the person I wanted to mention: there’s someone in China who somehow gets access to unreleased models and sells them on an eBay like site. Thanks to them, we already saw the TCS models and the bonus Stablemate for the Vintage Club before they were officially announced. Last week, while reading the Breyer forums, I came across what looks like the upcoming Christmas Morning Surprise: it’s Merry Dancer, and the original poster mentioned there might be two different colors too.</p>
    <p>Being curious, I looked up the seller’s page and was shocked to see what I think is the next Exotic Destinations web special, Salzburg. This happened the day before Breyer officially announced it! It even sold for about $35, which is unbelievable. The unreleased version had black spots instead of brownish ones—I'll add the photos below so you can compare.</p>

</center>
    <p>About the other model (Merry Dancer), I’m pretty shocked. Imagine if the whole Christmas surprise got leaked months before December... this really needs to stop, because it ruins the fun for everyone. I really don’t want to see them leak more unreleased models. I’ll only share the image of what might be the Christmas surprise, since there’s still a chance it could be a regular run or something else.</p>

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/268Rn59r/ojthwmqslopjkjk5boqp.jpg" width="400" height="400">
</center>
    <p>Now that Salzburg is official, here he is in the website images:</p>

</center>
    <p>I actually got picked and ended up buying him, even though the timing wasn’t great for me financially. I really shouldn’t have spent extra on other models right now, but oh well. I couldn’t resist, especially after I saw Nero the Stablemate was also available.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/1zBNHV1M/2DBBF295-C081-4AE7-92E9-3DDA20F4CDEF.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>Breyer also had their usual Christmas in July sale, and there were some pretty nice models available just for Collector Club members. One of them was Cardinal, which sold out almost instantly. Magpie sold out super fast too. Some older CC models were listed at surprisingly low prices even cheaper than some current Regular Runs! Here’s everything (for cc members) they offered:</p>

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/3Rw0brKh/IMG_4223.jpg" width="400" height="400">
</center>
    <p>Like I said, I really wanted Nero, but I didn’t want to pay international shipping just for one Stablemate. Once I got chosen for Salzburg, though, it felt like the universe telling me to go for it anyway lol.</p>
    <p>Lastly, here’s the sneak peek from July’s newsletter:</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/bYWS3j4X/IMG_4275.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>I personally think this will turn out to be the Halloween classic model.</p>
    <p>Thank you for your time to read my post! Stay tuned because in one of my next updates, I’ll show you the last medallion I finished a while ago but forgot I even had. I’d also love to make more collection showcase posts soon. Have a wonderful day :)</p>

    <p>Before finishing this post, Breyer opened the registrations for the Hoofbeats & Maple Treats Event. We did not see any pictures of the event models, but we got the names: Legacy and Tamarkuz which I already guessed (check the post that was published on 18 June 2025). Legacy seems to be the show jumping horse on the promo picture. I searched it up and Legacy was in fact competitor in the 2024 Paris Olympic games like we can see in that photo.</p>

    <h3>My Breyerfest</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 18 July 2025</p>
    <p>Hello! BreyerFest is over, and I wanted to share my experience. But before that, let’s cover a few things that happened before Friday which I didn’t have time to mention.</p>
    <p>Two of the contest prize models were glossy Salvino and Legend. There was also a secret raffle model that 20 lucky collectors won during the Thursday night party!</p>
<center>

</center>
    <center><p>Glitterbomb</p></center>
    <p>The raffle models were revealed a few days before BreyerFest, and I have to say, especially Cheers, looks amazing. In the live auction, instead of using these two models exactly as they are, they decided to gloss them!</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/d3h6C98s/IMG-3923.jpg" width="700" height="400"></center>
    <p>Lastly, I made some laminated paper horses to keep me company during BreyerFest. I printed out a few of my favourites from my collection, along with some SRs and LEs from this year.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/DmVNyNtk/AC1639B4-219C-462C-94FB-690408346B3D.jpg" width="500" height="400"></center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>As of now, I really enjoyed the live broadcasts and seminars, although I haven’t watched the workshop videos yet. Hopefully, since the content usually stays online for a month, I’ll find time to try making something soon.</p>
    <p>I also bought some models, which I’m very excited about! Unfortunately, I missed out on the online Stablemate because it sold out while I was out for dinner on Friday, which made me pretty sad. Still, I did manage to get Hats Off to You, the surprise model, and also Hoopla, which I really loved. I’m hoping to get a glossy version, but I have a feeling Breyer might surprise everyone with a secret variation that we’ll discover once models start arriving. Of course, this could be completely wrong just like my surprise model prediction! I really didn’t expect them to use Totilas since he was already a prize model, but here we are.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/L54tk3LY/f99qrnjmvvt5czapblk3.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <center><p>Surprise models</p></center>
    <p>I also tried bidding on an OOAK from the live auction. I almost got the Arabian mare and foal set, but someone outbid me. The price I offered was already quite high for me, but I still tried because I absolutely loved that set.</p>
    <p>The special runs this year are really fun ,especially with the secret variations, which seem to be very limited. At first, I thought these might be around 200 pieces, but since so few have turned up, I now guess the run might be closer to 25–50 or 75 to match the anniversary theme.</p>

    <center><p>Let's get this party started normal and secret variation</p></center>
    <p>Regarding other variations, Future is Bright had the already known short mane version that accidentally slipped in the emails, and Let the Good Times Roll has a matte + braided mane / glossy + long mane split. The exact numbers are still unknown.</p>

    <p>The online limited editions also have variations. Hoolpa is matte/glossy and Shinding comes in a kind of rainbow color.</p>

    <p>Something I thought was really clever is the Easter egg on Hats Off to You: the face markings represent Breyer’s 75th anniversary. There is a “7” on top and a “5” on the muzzle. I can’t wait to see mine!</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/HxhKFnzL/IMG_4057.jpg" width="425" height="400"></center>
    <p>The third variation of the volunteer model was also revealed—it’s a mix of the other two, and it looks beautiful. The manager model is the same variation but finished in gloss.</p>

    <p>During a seminar with Stephanie Macejko, a brand new sculpture was teased. Nothing official was announced, but it’s a stunning draft horse in a cantering or galloping pose. I think it might be part of the 2026 Premier Collection, or maybe Breyer will release it earlier.</p>

    <p>One of my favourite parts is always seeing the Collector Club tent display. Two things really caught my eye: the bonus Stablemate for the Premier Club (which looks fantastic) and the second Collector Club release. Later, Breyer confirmed the CC release will be named Juriann, coming in late October or early November. The deluxe CC stablemates were also displayed and they look very nice in this box that will probably come in with the pin.</p>

    <p>There was also a classic unicorn that is said to be a collector club release but it is still unknown</p>

    <p>Last but not least for Breyer, the live auction models sold on Saturday and the highest price was the Pegasus Alborozo, which went for an incredible $37,500! You can see all the results here: <a href="https://us.bidspirit.com/ui/catalog/auction/breyerfest/62257/1?lang=en">bidspirit.com</a> </p>

    <center><p>Next year's theme: Midsummer fair!</p></center>

    <p>This theme seems very interesting. I believe there will be a lot of Scandinavian horses as special runs and models in general. There will definitely be a Fjord and an Icelandic horse!</p>

    <p>Peter Stone also hosted an amazing event during BreyerFest weekend called Equilocity. One model that really caught my eye was this one:</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/HxYcFsxF/IMG_4062.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>I don’t know much about Peter Stone events, but I love seeing what models they come up with and always save photos of my favourites in a folder on my computer. I’ll make a post to share them with you soon!</p>
    <p>Another thing I want to mention is this 1:1 horse they had there that seems like something I would want to have in my house!</p>

    <p>Kylee Parks also made a new sculpture for Stone Horses that I absolutely love. The name is Harmony and it looks incredibly cute.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/B6mL39Pb/IMG_4059.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>I should not forget to mention that some people got this model as a Prize for the Equilocity show.</p>

    <p>Something interesting that doesn’t have to do exactly with BreyerFest: there is a seller from China who showed two Tractor Supply Company horses. The same person also posted an ad selling the fourth Vintage Club release, which is the clock horse Pioneer. In this ad, there was also a Stablemate that we have never seen before and will probably be the bonus Stablemate for this year. My theory is that this person works at the company that makes Breyers and was able to snag one and sell it. The Stablemate seems to be a mini version of Man o’ War. These are the images I found on Breyer forums:</p>

    <p>On an another not Breyerfest related note, two weeks ago I think, Breyer offered a test run to one CC member. I entered and I would buy it if I was chosen but of course I wasn't picked. The model was on the show jumping warmblood mold and had similar colors with this year's celebration horse Tight lanes.</p>

    <p>In this post I used many images that I got from other people. If you own one of the images and you want it removed please contact me and I will remove it.</p>

    <p>Thank you for stopping by to read my post! There were many exciting things that happened during Breyerfest and will continue to happen during the next days as they will probably annpounce the run numbers :)</p>

    <h3>Seize the Day Surprise updated prediction list</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 10 July 2025</p>
    <p>BreyerFest is tomorrow, and I wanted to share my final list with my guess for the surprise model.</p>
    <p>First of all, I had to eliminate the following molds completely:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Anamar, Raffle model</li>
    <li>Marabella, Auction</li>
    <li>Totilas, Prize model</li>
    <li>Georg, Prize model.</li>
</ul>
    <p>And now, here is my final prediction list for the Seize the Day Surprise:</p>
<ul>
    <li>1.Valegro, 2015</li>
    <li>2.Troubador, 2020</li>
    <li>3.Shannondel, 2016</li>
    <li>4.Fireheart, 2021</li>
    <li>5.Ashquar, 2013</li>
    <li>6.Idocus, 2009</li>
    <li>7.Vermeer, 2020</li>
    <li>8.Weather Girl, 2011</li>
    <li>9.Marwari, 2012</li>
    <li>10.Strapless, 2003.</li>
</ul>
    <p>For some reason, I think they might pick a mold that turns something this year (or maybe not). That’s why I chose my No. 1 and No. 2: Valegro turns 10, and Troubador turns 5 this year. As for the rest, it’s just based on a feeling, which could be completely wrong!</p>
    <p>My other 3 guesses that didn’t make it into the top 10 are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>11.Forever Saige, 2015</li>
    <li>12.Zafirah, 2022</li>
    <li>13.Goffert, 2006.</li>
</ul>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/HWbrCdCF/IMG-3988.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>I have to admit I’m a bit skeptical about my No. 2 (Troubador), since he was used in the Vintage Club gambler’s choice in 2023. The reason I still included him is because those colors were very similar, and I really think he deserves to be a surprise horse in beautiful colors!</p>
    <p>See you tomorrow for the big reveal :)</p>
