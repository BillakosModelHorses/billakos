    <h3>Collection Showcase #10</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 21 November 2025</p>
    <p>I got an OOAK! This Collection Showcase post is also an announcement. This is not a regular Premier Club Rowan, it's the one and only glossy mare version! What makes this model truly OOAK is that the factory gloss was applied only to the two special pieces Breyer gifted to the sculptor of the mold, Kelly Sealey. One stallion and one mare. She later offered them for auction, and I managed to get the version I wanted! The COA is a regular one, but Kelly told me she will create and send a special COA for me, which is really exciting. This was also the most anxious parcel I’ve ever waited for, because I needed many, many papers and documents for the package to go through customs. But now I finally have it, and I’m so happy it arrived safely.</p>

    <p>On Monday I’m leaving for 18 days, and it would have been such a bummer to wait that long to get my model. She’s really beautiful in person, and the dapples really pop. I noticed that there is no VIN code under the hoof! When I first saw this model in the Premier Club sneak peeks, I never imagined I would end up with the OOAK glossy version. It feels amazing to have such a rare model in my collection.</p>
    <p>There is also a video by NCModels, who won the auction for the glossy stallion version. You can watch it here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUlM4AqPggQ&t=269s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Glossy Stallion Rowan Video</a>

    <p>I hope you liked this post. It feels very surreal writing it! :)</p>

    <h3>2nd BMH show Horses</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 17 November 2025</p>
    <p>Hello! Now that the first awards have been handed out, I can finally show you the mascot horses for each certificate type. I drew these back in August, and to “unlock” each mascot you had to place in a class, a section, or a division. The Buckskin Mule is the most common one and my personal favourite.</p>
    <p>For the Section Champion, Reserve Champion, and Reserve to Reserve Champion, the certificates featured the Bronco Appy. Division winners (Champion, Reserve Champion, and Reserve to Reserve Champion) received the same style of certificate, but with the rarest mascot of all, the Appy Friesian. I was really happy with how they turned out, and I believe the people who received them enjoyed them as well!</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/bNjH894F/Untitled711_20251117031443.png" width="600" height="400"></center>
    <p>For those who haven’t received their prizes yet, please send me an email (billakosmodelhorses@gmail.com) with your omhps username so I can identify you and send your files via Google Drive. I’m updating the status on the username page as I go.</p>
    <p>I hope you like these horses! They were so much fun to draw, and I will definitely create more “prize” horses in future shows :)</p>

    <h3>Collection Showcase #9</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 31 October 2025</p>
    <p>🎃 Happy Halloween!! 🎃</p>
    <p>Since it’s this spooky day, I decided to show you my two spookier (or more Halloween themed) models! Unfortunately, I don’t (yet) have many Halloween horses in my collection, but I can still share a bit about the ones I do have. I’d love to add Cryptic, Calavera, Frankensteed, or even Frankenstein (lol) to my shelves one day, but for now, here’s what I’ve got:</p>
    <p>👻Spectre! I’ve loved this model ever since the day I saw the leaked catalogue photos! I got him as part of my name day gift from my parents in 2023. The color is amazing, that mix of gold and purple is just beautiful. I actually ordered him while I was away in Mexico and couldn’t wait for him to arrive… he showed up right on my name day!</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/BnVw4VXG/IMG-6553.jpg?v=1733934026" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>The little ghosts are adorable, and the glow in the dark effect is such a fun touch, which is something I really enjoy about all the Halloween horses. I often find myself admiring him before bed. This mold, sculpted by my favorite artist Brigitte Eberl, is phenomenal. I also love that it doesn’t take up too much shelf space (it’s quite compact in shape like a cube). Spectre is model #1876, on the Ashquar mold, and was the 2023 Halloween Horse.</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>This next one isn’t officially a Halloween horse, but its color definitely fits the spooky theme! It’s the Wild Things decorator variation, the online exclusive stablemate from BreyerFest 2024. It came in two versions, and while I was originally hoping for the non decorator one, I ended up really happy with this version. Only 1,050 pieces were made and it's the model #10098, on the Cantering Morgan (G5) mold.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/0yBHPBb1/IMG-6554.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>What I love most about him is the metallic green color. It’s stunning in gloss! The markings add extra personality, too. Overall, it’s a really fun model that gives off a great Halloween vibe!</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>As a little bonus, I wanted to include a few more small models in this Collection Showcase:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The 70th Anniversary Mystery Horse Surprise Woodgrain Clydesdale</li>
    <li>The 2021 Mustang Stablemate</li>
    <li>The Pintos and Palominos Gift Set</li>
</ul>
    <p>In September 2022, my family and I visited Portugal. While there, I found a tack store that carried Breyers and since it was along our route, I convinced my parents to stop by! They had some Classics and Stablemates, but because I didn’t have much luggage space, I decided to only buy Stablemates.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/P5RFTRP5/IMG-3053.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>I was so happy with my finds and super lucky, because I pulled my favorite model from the mystery bag! The Arabian Stablemate is one of my favorites because it’s so dynamic and elegant.</p>
    <p>I took this photo in our hotel room. The Mustang was missing back then, so I took a new photo at home today:</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/4xSFsSmC/IMG-6555.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>As always, have an amazing day and don’t forget to trick or treat! 🍬🎃 :)</p>

    <h3>2nd Model Horse Show - Concluded</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 19 October 2025</p>
    <p>The second BMH Model Horse Show has now concluded! There were so many amazing models entered in the classes, and I truly enjoyed judging this show. I was especially happy to see that almost all entries included collectability information in their descriptions. You can find the results by clicking the image below, which will direct you to the OMHPS show page.</p>

    <p></a></center></p>
    <p>As for the certificates, I’m currently working on writing all of them. There are three special horses for each certificate type (Class, Section, and Division), which I will reveal as soon as I send the certificates to the winners!</p>
    <p>Thank you everyone for supporting my website by entering the show, and congratulations to all the winners! Stay tuned for your rewards :)</p>

    <h3>Model Horse Updates</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 14 October 2025</p>
    <p>Hey guys! I’ve been working on judging the show over the past few weeks, which means I haven’t had much time to write anything here... There’s a lot to cover, but I decided that there’s no reason to announce every single Breyer release/ news unless there’s something I really want to talk about.</p>
    <p>I’ll start with one of the most exciting web specials ever created, which was released two weeks ago. The 2025 Wild Animal Series release, “Iquitos.” This frog-like horse is very unique, and I was really hoping to get picked. Unfortunately, I didn’t, and the secondary market prices were crazy!</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/15fHgnYr/iquitos-club-model-breyer-641963.webp" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>Moreover, Juriann was released and cost $75. Shipping wasn’t included, which actually makes me really happy because it means there’s no overcharge for international collectors. I hope it stays this way, as it also benefits US collectors who want to combine shipping if they add another item to their order (To overpack the order). Another thing to note is the bonus Stablemate for the Vintage Club is indeed a mini Man o’ War, like I mentioned in my previous post (18 July 2025).</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>My Deluxe Collector Club Stablemates and pin arrived last week, and I got my second favorite pick! The packaging is amazing, and I really love the premium feel of the set. Darius is beautiful. For the gambler’s choice Stablemate, my preference order was:</p>
<ul>
   <li>1. Wedgewood Blue</li>
    <li>2. Gold Charm</li>
    <li>3. Glossy Copenhagen</li>
    <li>4. Gold Florentine.</li>
</ul>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/zGcP8cVZ/IMG-6556.jpg?v=1758557522" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>Speaking of Stablemates, my dad surprised me with a whole box of Stablemates Mystery Surprise Series 4! Unfortunately, I didn’t get any of the chase models, but I got lucky with one of the Mini Whinnie Blind Barns ,which is a blue chase model!</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Fzq0bpnb/IMG-5378.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>In the image, you can see the box before I opened most of the models, along with the chase and some other ponies.</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>The last thing I want to talk about is the spoilers we got from the Holiday Catalog, which revealed some of the 2026 Club releases!</p>
    <p>For the Collector Club, we’re getting a Vanner mare for the first release. The Deluxe Collector Club offers Kiana on what appears to be the Madonna mold, along with a bonus pin featuring Kiana! The price for the Deluxe CC will be $80 for the 2025/2026 year. From that information, I can tell that the standard Collector Club will remain $30, and the Deluxe version $70, the same as in 2024.</p>

    <p>The Premier Club is getting Georgina, an AMAZING galloping draft mare!! I’m in love with this one. This was actually the mold that was shown during a presentation at BreyerFest.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/7hcS19QG/20251011-140638.jpg" width="215" height="400"></center>
    <p>For the Stablemates Club, Astoria isn’t a new sculpture, but a retake on the Belgian Drafter mold.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/1XTD0BYs/20251011-140643.jpg" width="215" height="400"></center>
    <p>As for the Vintage Club, there’s nothing new yet. I can’t wait to find out more about all the clubs. I’ll definitely be joining the Deluxe Collector Club, but I’m not thinking about any others because I don’t really like the commitment that comes with having to buy each model.</p>
    <p>Thank you so much for reading this post! As I mentioned earlier, I don’t plan to cover every release or announcement Breyer makes. From now on, I’ll focus on things that I find interesting or worth talking about  and, of course, more about my own model horse journey. See you very soon :)</p>
