    <h3>BreyerMidwest, BF tickets, show & book</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 18 March 2025</p>
    <p>Hello! Today I will talk about many things I have on my mind! First of all, BreyerMidwest is this weekend, which is very exciting because we will see some BreyerFest special runs and limited editions in person. Of course, for people who are lucky to be there in Kansas, this is not the most exciting part, but for me, it is (I just realised that we will also see the volunteer model for 2025!). Moreover, BreyerFest tickets will go on sale tomorrow. There is a discounted price until 30 of April, so don't forget to get yours before that.</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>Stormy Strike made a tier list for all the BF models, and this is how I ranked them. Hats off to you, definitely in the special category with the cute Fjord stablemate.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/TwzkNp4d/2025-03-17-235905633.png" width="600" height="400"></center>
    <p>You can do yours here: https://tiermaker.com/create/breyerfest-2025-models-356195</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>Last week I posted my Online Model Horse Show, and so far, there are more than 40 showers and 900 entries, which is very exciting. I took a peek at the OOAK classes, and there were 2 entries so far. The one I saw was a horse I didn't know existed, but it is a very cool blank ASB foal that was supposed to be flockie rocking model, meaning that there is no mane/tail. If you haven't seen the show, the deadline to enter is April 9th.</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>The most limited horse I have ever had is currently in customs, and I can't wait for it to come. I will definitely show it to you once it arrives. It will probably be out in 3-4 days, and I was thinking of opening it on my birthday, which is on March 29th. I don't believe I will be able to wait, but who knows.</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>Tomorrow is also a great day because the new Hunger Games book will be released! I have already preordered it, and I will have it in my hands in just a few hours (it's almost midnight right now).</p>
    <p>I hope you have a wonderful day :)</p>

    <h3>BMH 1st show</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 7 March 2025</p>
    <p>Hello! I just announced the first edition of the model horse show series that I am hosting on omhps.com. You can find more information there!</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/YqsvwX5K/image0-1.png" width="600" height="400"></center>

    <h3>Sneak Peak: February</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 1 March 2025</p>
    <p>Hi everyone! Yesterday, Breyer sent out the monthly newsletter to Collector Club members, which included a sneak peek of the model that will be offered to members in March. Here is the image:</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/15hLCBJ7/IMG_7666.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>This one reminds me of sand. I’m guessing that it will be the next model in the Exotic Destinations series and will represent a city or country well known for its beaches or a popular summer travel destination.</p>
    <p>Have a great day :)</p>

    <h3>Updates</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 28 February 2025</p>
    <p>Hello! I haven’t posted anything here for a while, even though I had some free time to do so. I guess I just wasn’t that motivated. However, I have been doing other things in my life, such as going out with my friends and having fun with my dogs. Another exciting thing for me is that I went skiing for the first time! At first, I took a one hour lesson, and then my friends took me to a slope. I was very scared, but I managed to go down with only four falls! It was extremely fun, and by the end of the day, I was actually doing great for my first time. I felt more confident and was able to turn much better. Two weeks later, we decided to go again, and last Wednesday, I was back on the slopes! This time, everything was much better. I had a lot more balance and control compared to the first time. The only downside was that at some point, there was mist, which made it even harder for me.</p>
    <p>Regarding model horses, I purchased a very limited edition horse from a seller on Facebook, but it hasn’t arrived yet. It was quite an expensive model, so I decided that if I got this one, I wouldn’t be buying any other models this year (except for the Celebration Horse and maybe Hats Off to You). I might still end up getting another model if it’s something I just can’t pass up, like an extremely beautiful Collector Club release.</p>
    <p>Moreover, I started making another medallion of a braided warmblood horse. It’s still in the very early stages:</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/QtZ4xpLB/IMG-2544.jpg" width="300" height="400"></center>
    <p>Last but not least, I really want to start a series of online model horse shows on omhps.com, and I might begin working on it very soon.</p>
    <p>As always, I hope you liked this post. Bye :)</p>

    <h3>Maddox is here but will he be here??</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 7 February 2025</p>
    <p>Hey everyone. Today, Breyer released Maddox, the first Collector Club special run for 2025. I have a few things to say about this model. I really like the dapple gray color, and this mold is spectacular. However, I decided not to get him for 4 reasons, which are the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>I would like to save the $180 that I would have to spend on Maddox ($90 + $55 for shipping + $35 for customs/import taxes). This will help me with my 2025 goals (1. Getting my first Artist Resin, 2. Acquiring a Connoisseur model, 3. Getting a Breyer with fewer than 100 pieces) as I will have more money to put into these models.</li>
    <li>This mold is very long and quite tippy, and right now, I don't have much space, so I wouldn't know where to put it.</li>
    <li>Even though I like this model, it's not something I absolutely must have. As I mentioned, I don’t have much space, and I want to limit my purchases this year to more exclusive and rarer pieces.</li>
    <li>The Breyer warehouse has been a mess in the last couple of months, and I wouldn’t like a random model surprise after waiting for a month for my Maddox.</li>
</ul>
<center>
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/W3VjJs70/maddox-club-model-breyer-605934-1240x998.webp" width="400" height="400">
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/JnQ8NSTv/maddox-club-model-breyer-841694-1240x998.webp" width="400" height="400">
</center>
    <p>I will say it again. I really can't understand what Breyer is thinking with the free domestic shipping. It’s harming international collectors. I have seen many people complaining in the comments about this issue. It is extremely unfair for a model to include the domestic shipping cost in its price while making international buyers pay even more. That was the reason why I didn’t join the Vintage Club, and unless I really love a model, I am probably not going to get it.</p>
    <p>Speaking of the Vintage Club, look at this cute release that is based on the Walter Farley series! Inferno comes with a really cute vintage blanket and a book!</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/d3tY4np1/xuigwuuemr30riift6ig.png" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>All in all, I am not getting Maddox unless I change my mind before he sells out/retire. I am finally free from my exams (which, unfortunately, did not end well) and can rest before the next semester starts! I hope you have a wonderful day :)</p>

    <h3>Crystal, Prague and new Schleich scale</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 5 February 2025</p>
    <p>Hello collectors. Today I will talk about some new Breyer models and I will show you some extremely exciting news about Schleich! First of all, this is the last remaining BreyerFest Limited Edition for this year, and it's, of course, the crystal model. They named it Standing Ovation, and it's the crystal version of the American Saddlebred mold. I like it, and it could be a great souvenir to remember this milestone for the company. I haven't yet decided what I am going to purchase this year, and I have to put a lot of thought into it because there are many exceptional models I like this year, and it will probably be very expensive...</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/W4WDBc7s/Standing-Ovation-R.webp" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>Next on the line is Prague (the latest addition to the Exotic Destination Series)! I have many things to say about this one. I love these series just because I love visiting other countries, and when I see a model that is made/named after a place I have been to, I really want it. That is the case with Prague, as I visited this town in December. It was extremely beautiful, and I think the model fits the theme quite a bit. The dapple gray coat looks very wintery, like snow, and Prague is one of the best Christmas destinations.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/NMqYnNrd/Prague-Bothsides-2048x2048.webp" width="800" height="400"></center>
    <p>Here are some photos I took while I was there!</p>
<center>
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/66SBRbT8/IMG-1192.jpg" width="300" height="400">
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/x1Lj9Gfc/IMG-1219.jpg" width="300" height="400">

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/gkXkTF1y/IMG-1391.jpg" width="300" height="400">
</center>
    <p>Besides the model, there was something else I wanted to talk about. I might sound negative, but there is something that needs to be done. When they opened the club subscriptions, they announced an increase in the models but with free DOMESTIC ONLY shipping. What about international buyers? We have to pay extra for the shipping, which is something I understand as it is more expensive, but the problem is that we pay the extra price that otherwise would be the domestic shipping. What I mean is that on top of the price increase (for the "free" shipping), we have to pay around 60-70 USD more! That is very unfair, and they did the same with the web special, and I am afraid they will do this with Collector Club models as well. I really want Breyer to do something about this because it is ridiculous to increase the price for international collectors with no bonus at all. I think this is bad for U.S. collectors as well, as they can't add a Stablemate in order to get a bigger box for their model since they would have to pay extra shipping.</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>Big news for Schleich! They are going to introduce a new horse collection in 1:12 scale. How amazing is that? They announced this at a toy exhibition in Germany, and modellpferdeversand.de shared this information with us on their blog. As they mentioned, the models are planned to come out late in 2025, and there is no information on the price yet. I believe they will be around 30 USD. These are the five horses they revealed there. My favorite is the braided warmblood on the left.</p>

    <center><p>The image belongs to modellpferdeversand.com</p></center>
    <p>Thank you for joining me on another blog post! I hope you enjoy the work I am doing here. Right now, I am very excited for many things, such as finishing my exams on Friday and planning some model horse related things that, if they go right, I will show them to you! :)</p>

    <h3>Seize the Day Surprise early prediction</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 3 February 2025</p>
    <p>Happy Monday! As we approach BreyerFest and many models have been revealed, I think it's time to show you which models are currently on my list and which molds have been eliminated for the Seize the Day Surprise. I won’t go through every mold because that would take forever, but I will make a list of the remaining ones. Here is an image with all of them:</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/nL0H0kh9/IMG-0530.jpg" width="1200" height="400"></center>
    <p>The ones marked in red have been eliminated for various reasons. For example, some are very old and unpopular, while others have been or will be released in 2025 as regular runs, special runs, limited editions, club models, etc.</p>
    <p>The remaining molds are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Anamar</li>
    <li>Andalusian Mare</li>
    <li>Ashquar</li>
    <li>Boomerang</li>
    <li>Bouncer</li>
    <li>Brighty</li>
    <li>Cantering Warmblood</li>
    <li>Vermeer</li>
    <li>Georg</li>
    <li>Goffret</li>
    <li>Gypsy Vanner</li>
    <li>Icelandic</li>
    <li>Kennebec Count</li>
    <li>Lipizzaner Mare</li>
    <li>Lipizzaner Stallion</li>
    <li>Marabella</li>
    <li>Mangalarga Marchador</li>
    <li>Marwari</li>
    <li>Missouri Fox Trotter</li>
    <li>Troubadour</li>
    <li>Mustang Mare</li>
    <li>Mustang Stallion</li>
    <li>Newsworthy</li>
    <li>Nokota</li>
    <li>Astrid</li>
    <li>Othello</li>
    <li>Paso Fino</li>
    <li>Peruvian Paso</li>
    <li>Rain</li>
    <li>Ruffian</li>
    <li>Shagya Arabian</li>
    <li>Shannondell</li>
    <li>Zafirah</li>
    <li>Duende</li>
    <li>Spirit</li>
    <li>Constantia</li>
    <li>Firefly</li>
    <li>Strapless</li>
    <li>Susecion</li>
    <li>Totilas</li>
    <li>Weather girl</li>
    <li>Valegro</li>
    <li>Vanner Mare</li>
    <li>Carrick</li>
    <li>Idocus</li>
    <li>Welsh Mare</li>
    <li>Wixom</li>
    <li>Zippo Pine Bar.</li>
</ul>
    <p>Some of these are very unlikely to be the surprise model, but I haven’t crossed them out yet. I don’t currently have a top 10, but there are specific molds that could be perfect for the Seize the Day Surprise. As Breyer reveals more models throughout the year, I will continue to remove molds from the list and update it. In the end, just before BreyerFest, I will share my final predictions! :)</p>

    <h3>More Breyerfest reveals so far</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 30 January 2025</p>
    <p>Hey! I have been very inactive lately, and I really want to change that. I will finish my exams on the 7th of February, and I will have more time for model horses! I am also thinking of hosting my first online model horse show for collectability. Regarding BreyerFest, they have revealed all the Special Runs. I will make a post with my ranking list.</p>
<center><h3><span style="color: #2c789c;">Limited Editions</span></h3></center>
    <p>This year's classic scale limited edition is a portrait horse! It's called "Game Day Surprise." I love this model, and I think the accessory is very cute!</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/8PQkr7pn/B-EV-10448-Game-Day-Surprise-with-Sash-R-1024x1024.webp" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>Beau N’ Arrow is another limited edition based on a vaulting horse. I can't wait to see him in the covered arena live with his squad!</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/T1mR4699/B-EV-10449-Beau-N-Arrow-R-1024x1024.webp" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>This is the Best of BreyerFest - Series 6 models! These models are based on the ones from BreyerFest 2015 Vive La France: Parfait, C’est Bon!, Truffles, Crème de la Crème, and Tout Suite.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/NjQgpZr6/B-EV-10462-Best-of-Breyer-Fest-Box-Silo-Web-448x360.webp" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>The little Fjord is the one I want the most. Unfortunately, I am not going to get this set as I have a limit on the money I am spending on Breyer's website, and I would prefer to get something else.</p>
<center><h3><span style="color: #2c789c;">In-Person Special Runs</span></h3></center>
    <p>Yolo is a weird name for a model, but here is a dapple gray Vanner. I like this one, but not as much as others and probably wouldn't choose it if I was going to Breyerfest in person.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/pLVHD8gk/YOLO-L-1024x1024.webp" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>"Life's a Journey" is this year's non-equine special run model! It's a Collie with a blue merle coat. I didn’t know what merle was until I got my real life dog earlier this year, which is merle.</p>
<center>
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/L5dSfWpZ/Lifes-A-Journey-L-1024x1024.webp" width="400" height="400">
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/RCf49v71/Lifes-A-Journey-R-1024x1024.webp" width="400" height="400">
</center>
    <p>The bandana is extremely cute, and I’m lowkey glad that it's not available online, as it would make the preference form even harder for me.</p>
<center><h3><span style="color: #2c789c;">In-Person / Online SR</span></h3></center>
    <p>To the Ties That Bind Us is the decorator special run, and I really like it! I love that they used the same pattern as the 75th Anniversary models with the silhouettes of the different molds. The blue color is really nice, and I am seriously considering putting it in my preference form.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/wjWdFMzz/To-the-Ties-That-Bind-Us-1024x1024.webp" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>This year's surprise model is called Seize the Day Surprise. I will post my current prediction list soon and update it regularly because there are a lot of possibilities right now.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Yq6rNtj2/111124-BF25-Seize-The-Day-Surprise-logo-final-KM-1024x1024.webp" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>The next special run is my favorite! Hats Off to You is the vintage model SR, and I am absolutely in love with it. I love this mold, and the color is amazing. It comes with two hats: a regular western hat and a PARTY HAT!!! How amazing is that?</p>
<center>
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/xCNYX2W2/Hats-Off-R-1024x1024.webp" width="400" height="400">
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Xvz4NJ1L/Hats-off-Party-L-1024x1024.webp" width="400" height="400">
</center>
    <p>This will be my top choice for sure.</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>Last but not least, we got a model on the Criollo mold. Future is Bright is a beautiful palomino with a lot of dapples! I really like this version with the long mane.</p>
<center>

</center>

    <p>Hooplah is this year's online traditional model. I really like this model, and I might add it to my cart. I hope there will be a matte/glossy split on this one, as I really want it in glossy.</p>

    <p>The online exclusive stablemate that I will definitely get is Shindig. I am not in love with the color, but I quite like it. I am sure that there will be a fun variation on this one.</p>

    <p>While writing this, they revealed the plush. Meet Party Pal!</p>

    <p>I believe that there will be micro runs of 75 pieces for many of the models. I hope you enjoyed today’s post, and again, I am very sorry for my inactivity. After my exams, I will definitely be more active. Have a nice evening :)</p>

    <h3>Breyerfest reveals so far</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 13 January 2025</p>
<center><h3><span style="color: #2c789c;">Event Stablemates</span></h3></center>
    <p>This year, I love all the stablemates. If I had to put them in order, I would say:</p>
<ul>
    <li>1. Bellini</li>
    <li>2. Cava</li>
    <li>3. Prosecco</li>
    <li>4. Mimosa</li>
</ul>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/PfphJQmk/B-EV-10460-Break-Out-the-Bubbles-box-1024x1024.webp" width="600" height="400"></center>
    <p>I will definitely search for the polo pony (Bellini) and maybe Cava. These names are very fun and fit the theme very well! I also love that they did realistic colors this time as I did not like last year's stablemates</p>
<center><h3><span style="color: #2c789c;">Limited Editions</span></h3></center>
    <p>Belesema Sapphire is the first portrait model of a horse that Breyer revealed. It's a chestnut mare.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/w38wjpD3/B-EV-10447-Belesema-Sapphire-R-1024x1024.webp" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>I am not sure, but I might purchase her. I really like this mold, and I believe that there might be a variation with all 3 versions of it.</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>Halcyonia Night Life is the second LE. To be honest, this model doesn't excite me. I am not a huge fan of black models as I find them a bit boring. In the images, there are some dapples, which is nice, but still, I don't see this model and say wow.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/WzJ9V3FQ/B-EV-10445-Halcyonia-Night-Life-L-1024x1024.webp" width="400" height="400"></center>
<center><h3><span style="color: #2c789c;">In-Person Special Runs</span></h3></center>
    <p>The reveal party started with "Get This Party Started"! This pinto Connemara is only available to in-person attendees, but I don't mind it as it is not my cup of tea. It's a beautiful model but not something I would want to purchase.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/fbBqj1Qg/Get-This-Party-Started-R-1024x1024.webp" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>Nothing I said about the previous model applies to this one. We got the mare and foal set "Good Times and Great Friends," and unfortunately, it is only available in person. This set is amazing, and when I saw the images, I got very excited—until I saw the availability.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/85cKyw1k/Good-Times-Great-Friends-1024x1024.webp" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>I am thinking of not getting anything during BreyerFest weekend and try for this set in the second-chance sale. I might get lucky and snag one. The gloss is amazing, and I would gladly pair them with Bolero to make a cute family.</p>
<center><h3><span style="color: #2c789c;">In-Person / Online SR</span></h3></center>
    <p>The only online-available special run we have seen so far is "Let the Good Times Roll". It's a sooty buckskin leopard Appaloosa on the Show Jumping Warmblood mold. I really like this model, and I might include it in the top of my preference list.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/sXLnbSXY/Let-the-Good-Times-Roll-L-1024x1024.webp" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>For this Special Run there could be a loose/braided mane and tail split on this one or matte/glossy split (or even both).</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>I believe that this year they will do many fun surprises with the models. There will most probably be micro runs and some very exciting variations. Breyer will continue to reveal more models in the upcoming weeks, and I will mention them here. Thank you for reading today's posts. Have a great week :)</p>

    <h3>Dogs, PC and Midas!</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 13 January 2025</p>
    <p>Happy Monday! I haven't been that active lately regarding model horses because there are many things happening in my life. First of all, I got 2 puppies! My mum wanted a poodle, but I wanted a Dachshund, and we got both of them. They are very cute, but I have to watch them and take care of them. I named mine Pretzel, and here she is:</p>

    <p>Something I wanted to talk about but did not have the time for is the Premier Club. I was thinking of joining but decided not to in the end. This lineup is amazing, and I love all 3 models. The thing I like the most is the choice of braided/loose on Rowan and the matte/glossy choice on Cosimo. Moreover, the chance to get the micro-run gray Winnifred made me think about it a bit more.</p>

    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>I finally found one of my top grails in Europe! I finally got Midas and I can't wait for him to arrive. I have been looking for one but did not want to spend a lot on shipping fees and customs. I also did not want to spend much money on models right now but when I saw Midas on eBay, I couldn't let him pass. The price was very reasonable too.</p>
    <p>I will talk about the BreyerFest reveals we have in the next post (I already posted it)...</p>

    <h3>Christmas haul 2024</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 5 January 2025</p>
    <p>Hello! Today, I’ll show you everything I got for Christmas! Some of these are models I purchased myself, while others were gifts from my family.</p>
    <p>First of all, I finally got the Stablemate wooden display barn! I chose the older version with the white and blue colors. Instead of getting an advent calendar this year, I decided to open one horse every weekend in December. On the 24th, I opened the display barn! I love the Stablemates, but my favorite is this bay Valegro!</p>

    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>Next on the list is the polo pony! I finally found one at an amazing price. I opened this model on Christmas Day instead of New Year’s, which is when we usually exchange gifts.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/KvC0H1CZ/B06648-B8-88-B9-41-E6-BB2-E-A3-B64-D27-D1-BA.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>The next horse is this Peter Stone MiniMe Blue Granite in Glossy, which is from the Equilocity event of 2006 and I think there were 50 made.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/8c0ZDc5m/AA1-ED9-F0-6-EFC-43-CC-805-A-8847-D31-D9-EEA.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>Moving on, I got Ivy! I’ve wanted this model for a very long time, and when a seller from Germany listed one, I snagged it as fast as I could!</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/sXKn6wC8/ADA7874-E-89-CE-4354-9-CE3-6-C755-A7-EED1-E.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>Check out this amazing porcelain model that my cousin got for me in Vienna! She visited the Spanish Riding School shop just for me and picked out this stunning statue/model. It’s now proudly displayed in my model cabinet as it’s such a special piece in my collection.</p>

    <p>This year, my parents gave me Zafirah for the holidays, and I couldn’t be happier. It’s such a handsome model with incredible details. The face is especially cute!</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/J0np9Z1h/68-AD5753-487-F-4-B20-ADF3-BEF94-A25146-B.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>

    <p>Last but not least, I finally unboxed Calista! I ordered her back in September but decided to open her on my name day (January 1st).</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/FHJBry0d/99-ADE5-C1-4-DA6-4-D24-AD94-9-F77-A6-F81-FAB.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>I hope you enjoyed my haul! I’ll talk more about each model in a future collection showcase. Have an amazing day :)</p>
