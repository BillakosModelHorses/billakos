    <h3>Collection Showcase #8</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 16 August 2025</p>
    <p>Hello! I haven't posted a collection showcase in a very long time and I really don't know why... I decided to come back with a very special model of mine which is of course Midas! This amazing piece was released in 2021 as a lottery model for Collector Club members. The model number is #712418 and there were only 250 pieces made, making him quite limited.</p>
    <p>For me, he was my top holy grail for a long time, and even though there are many on the US market, I wanted to find one in Europe because I didn't want to pay $700–800 (including the shipping fee and customs). There was one for sale at some point in a German store, but he was quickly bought. The price of that one became the price range for my future searches. In January of this year, an eBay seller listed him at a better price than my range, and without a second thought I got him!</p>

</center>
    <p>He is a really nice copy, and I love all the mapping and details he has. Something that makes him even more special is that he was hand-painted at Breyer’s New Jersey facility by the same artisans who create the BreyerFest raffle and auction models as well as other very limited pieces.</p>
    <p>This is by far one of the prettiest horses in my collection, and I believe he is also highly desirable among collectors. I hope you liked this Collection Showcase :)</p>

    <h3>Collection Showcase #7</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 28 December 2024</p>
    <p>Hello Santa's little helpers! I decided to show you 3 Winter themed horses today! Two of these are some of my favorite models in my collection, and I believe you will love them as much as I do!</p>
    <p>The first one is Astrid! I got this mare from da Vinci Creations in March 2023! Fjord horses have always been one of my favorite breeds, and I had to get Astrid. The glossy version was my top choice as it makes her color really pop. Her coat is called Grå, and she has a stripe down her back plus a star on her head!</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/j5VQgwTT/88177EE2-53C8-401A-BDE7-0B02C1196D56.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>Astrid was released in 2021 as part of the Premier Club. Members could choose between Matte or Glossy versions.</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>The next horse is a stablemate Fjord I randomly have in my collection. It is from the Blind Bag Surprise Series 3.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/SNmVbMMN/2CCED4A6-FD77-486C-8416-6FE544131CBD.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>Last but not least, this is Neva!!! When he was released, I was amazed by the snowman markings. Unfortunately, I did not get him at the release, and then he sold out. In September 2023, a shop in Europe put some up for sale, and I quickly snatched one. When he arrived, I resisted the temptation to open him and waited until December 25th. It was incredibly difficult to have a model and not open it, but I managed, and it made Christmas feel even more special!!</p>

    <p>Neva was the Winter Classic for 2022, and you could only get him directly from Breyer.</p>
    <p>I hope you enjoyed today's Collection Showcase! Have a great day :)</p>

    <h3>Collection Showcase #6</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 19 December 2024</p>
    <p>Hey Collectors! Welcome to Collection Showcase number 6!! Today I will show you 2 traditional horses and 1 classic that I have in my collection.</p>
    <p>Starting off with a classic, I have a regular run on the Rearing Stallion mold, originally created in 1965 by Chris Hess. I chose this model because I’ve always liked the Traditional Fighting Stallion and I thought that the silver bay coat looks great on this mold. As I’m writing this, I just realized something! The Classic mold isn’t exactly the same as the Traditional! I always thought they just shrunk the Traditional mold, but it turns out they didn’t.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/TPV6bYCS/IMG_1671.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>The second horse is the Traditional Fighting Stallion, created in 1961 by Chris Hess. This stunning glossy chestnut pinto model was originally made for Breyer’s 70th Anniversary in 2020 and was later glossed for the Collector Club Appreciation Event!</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/05c9ZjP1/IMG_1663.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>I found this guy on eBay, and my parents got him for my 19th birthday. Breyer hasn’t published an official run number for this model, but while reading a list from the Boo Photo Show, I discovered that there might be fewer than 160 made, which is insane!</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>The last model I’m going to show you is a more modern one, Adamek! He’s a gorgeous regular-run Akhal-Teke released in 2022. I’m including him here because I got him along with the Classic Rearing Stallion. What I love most about him is the mapping on his head. There aren’t many regular runs with that level of detail.</p>
<center>
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/MHKqq20L/IMG_1666.jpg" width="400" height="400">
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/zXv8QNGb/IMG_1669.jpg" width="250" height="400">
</center>
    <p>This mold is incredible and so dynamic. The only downside? It takes up a lot of space!</p>
    <p>I hope you liked todays models! Byee :)</p>

            <h3>Collection Showcase #5</h3>
            <p class="date">Published on 4 November 2024</p>

<p>Welcome back to another collection showcase! Today, I have two models to share that I got from Austria, the land with no kangaroos!! There's a funny story behind how I got them. During my last year of high school, instead of studying for exams, I found myself browsing eBay for plastic ponies. That’s when I came across a seller offering both Starlight and Glossy Benelli for not that much. I couldn't decide which one I wanted more (both had the same price), but in the end, I chose Starlight.</p>

<p>She arrived about a week after I placed the order, and the seller included a sweet little note saying thank you, which made me really happy. I showed it to my dad, and he got so excited that he asked if the seller had anything else I wanted. I showed him Benelli, and he told me to go ahead and get it! My mom helped me with the purchase since I was still a minor and didn’t have my own card at the time.</p>

<p>The following week, when Benelli was due to arrive, I skipped school so I could be home to open him. (My excuse for skipping? Studying!) When he finally came, I recorded a hilarious unboxing video to send to my friend who was stuck at school-lol. </p>

<center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/2j7bf94Q/IMG-4355.jpg" width="403" height="302"></center>

<p>Starlight was released in 2020 as part of the vintage club. She was limited to 500 pieces and mine has the number 278/500 making her one of my most limited Breyers I have.</p>

<center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/J4RXDC1Y/IMG-4354.jpg" width="403" height="302"></center>

<p>Benelli was a limited edition horse in the 2020 Breyerfest Celtic Fling that was held online due to quarantine. To get him in glossy you had to preorder him and he was limited to 2675 pieces.</p>

    <h3>Collection Showcase #4</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 15 October 2024</p>

    <p>October means Oktoberfest! (This post was intended to go up earlier in the month, but I forgot.) What better way to celebrate than by showing you some of the Breyerfest 2022 models, as the theme was Prost!</p>

    <p><center><span style="color: #000000;">Nikolas</span></center></p>

    <p>Nikolas was the celebration model for that year. He was sculpted by Bridgette Eberl, and the first release of the mold was actually on him! As you might know, I got my first Breyer Traditional horse at the beginning of 2022, so that was the first year I wanted to join Breyerfest. I bought an online Traditional Access ticket, which came with Nikolas. I remember watching this <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7q1wwxbik?feature=shared">video</a> and getting very excited. During BreyerFest, I didn't get any other model except Nikolas, but when he finally arrived all the way from the US, I was very impressed! According to the IDYB page, 12.354 of these were made.</p>

    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Qt9gnyGM/0-A3-CDDB5-B2-F9-481-A-BCCF-8-F3-A0-D517688.jpg" width="403" height="302"></center>

    <p><center><span style="color: #DD0000;">Brahms</span></center></p>

    <p>Brahms was a present from my parents for my 18th birthday! He was a special run for that year, but I got him from a shop in Europe the next year (instead of during BreyerFest). I really liked the Big Ben mold, and I've always loved leopard Appaloosa horses, which made this particular model really stand out to me, especially in the glossy finish. The run number is 2.200.</p>

    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/x8Lv9NdD/9-FC49-D1-D-2648-47-E2-821-C-8-FE9-A62-EAC5-D.jpg" width="403" height="302"> <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/pVjYf4JG/2-DDD49-C4-5025-41-CD-B5-D8-8-FF1-B8-B28529.jpg" width="403" height="302"> </center>

    <p><center><span style="color: #FFCC00;">Chablis</span></center></p>

    <p>I got this horse during BreyerFest 2024, two years after its release! To be honest, I never considered getting this horse until I saw him in the background of a video. The real horse is very beautiful, and I think Breyer did an amazing job creating its portrait model (the Idocus mold fits perfectly). Both online and in-person BreyerFest attendees could get him in the store. Chablis is a limited edition with 3.000 pieces made. Sadly, mine doesn't have many dapples, but it was the one I could find at a reasonable price, so I don't mind that much.</p>

 <h3>Collection Showcase #3</h3>
            <p class="date">Published on 3 October 2024</p>

      
<p>Happy Spooktober! Today, I will be showing you one model from each of Peter Stone’s scales!</p>

<p>First, we have an adorable Chip horse on the Quarter Horse mold. I acquired this model from a Stablemate lot, and unfortunately, I don’t have much information on when it was produced or how limited it is.</p>

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/2S77td5s/410-CBD34-2-F1-F-4-A12-8-C19-84816666315-D.jpg" width="403" height="302">

<p>Next is the Pebbles scale! I found this beautiful Warmblood at a great price, and I couldn’t resist buying it. I believe it was a regular run in the early 2000s, but I’m not completely sure.</p>

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/tTYd7Lzb/6-E242626-1-D25-46-F4-B8-F5-860-A40-D9656-A.jpg" width="403" height="302">

<p>The last and largest scale is the Stone (1:9). I have two Stone horses, and today I’ll show you Cutter. He’s on the ISH (Ideal Stock Horse) mold, and he was a regular run released in 2002.</p>

            <h3>Collection Showcase #2</h3>
            <p class="date">Published on 22 September 2024</p>

      
<p>In the first collection showcase I showed you my first model horse and my first Breyer stablemates. Today I will introduce you to the first 2 traditional horses I ever got.</p>

<p>My first Traditionals were a New Year's gift in 2022. In Greece, many families don’t open gifts on December 25th but wait until January 1st, after the new year begins. That’s when I opened mine, and the first traditional horse I saw was Catch Me! I was completely shocked at how big he was. I wasn’t expecting a plastic horse to be that large, since I was only used to Schleichs and Stablemates. Then I opened Theo, the horse I had been most excited about. Owning a Traditional horse was something I had wanted for a long time. In 2020, I discovered the hobby and Breyer horses, and I really wanted to be part of it. Unfortunately, being in Europe meant I had to spend a lot to get them from the US, so I gave up on the idea for a while. Before Christmas in 2021, my dad asked me what I wanted for the holidays, and I mentioned that a Breyer horse would be amazing, but I couldn’t find any in Europe. Later that day, he easily found a store in Germany that sold them (I felt pretty silly for not finding it myself!) and told me to pick two. For my first models, I chose Theo, whom I adored, and I specifically wanted a sport or warmblood horse to start with so I chose Catch Me.</p>

<p>Catch me was released in 2019 and he is a regular run model.</p>

<p>Theo was released in 2021  and he is also a regular run model.</p>

            <h3>Collection Showcase #1</h3>
            <p class="date">Published on 10 September 2024</p>

            <p> Welcome to the first collection showcase! In this series, I’ll be sharing my models, explaining how and where I got them, along with some additional interesting details about each one. </p>

<p>For the first showcase, I decided to show you my first ever Schleich (my first model horse ever), and my first stablemates that started my love for Breyer horses.</p>

<p>My first ever model horse was a Schleich Friesian. I don’t remember exactly when I got it, but I do recall being at a toy store near my house, where there was a stand filled with Schleich animals, including horses. After picking up that Friesian, I started buying more both to collect and to play with. Schleichs became my favorite childhood toy, and since then I have collected many. While I don’t plan to feature them all here, I might share some of the ones that hold special meaning to me.</p>

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/kM8CxNRH/IMG-0065.jpg" width="403" height="302">

<p>The next model is my first ever Breyer horse! It was sometime around 2017 and I was out with my family when i entered a hobby store. They had some Stablemates on display for just €2, and they immediately caught my eye. I spent a bit of time looking at them, unsure which one to choose, but eventually, I decided on the Hanoverian gelding. When we sat down to eat at a restaurant, I unpacked the horse and was truly amazed with its quality. I had expected the figure to be made of soft plastic, but it was much sturdier and of far better quality than I imagined. I was so impressed that I went straight back to the store and bought a few more! </p>

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/wMKdCMZF/IMG-0062.jpg" width="403" height="302">

<p>These are the other Stablemates that were available in the store. I don’t quite remember which ones I bought on the day I found the Hanoverian gelding, as I ended up revisiting the store a few months later and purchased the rest!</p>

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/kXmmwVxg/IMG-0063.jpg" width="483" height="290">

<p>As you can see I have played a lot with these horses.</p>

<p>Thank you all for reading that, if you like it please let me know in the comment box. In the next showcase I will show you the first 2 traditional horses I ever got! </p>
