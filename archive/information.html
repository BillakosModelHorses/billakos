    <h3>Catch the Horses mini game!</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 20 November 2024</p>
    <p>Hi! I finally made a model horse related mini game. It is very simple: You have to move the shopping bags in order to catch the model horses. If you fail 5 times the game will stop. You will find more information there!</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/g0htNnzL/40676C94-CA75-40E6-904E-0DA90F9A2303.png" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>To enter it just go to the Home page or click here:</p><a href="https://billakosmodelhorses.com/game/catchthehorses.html">Catch the Horses mini game</a>
    <p>I might add different models in the future or change the backround. It was very hard for me to create this game and it might not run perfectly. If you have any suggestions please let me know. Have fun catching horses :)</p>

    <h3>Paddock Chat Information</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 19 November 2024</p>
    <p>Welcome to the Paddock Chat!! This is an open chat area where people can talk about model horses or anything they want! It won’t be open all the time and will close at certain periods. I’ll likely create a schedule, but for now, it will be random. It could be open for a weekend, a month, or who knows how long! (No one knows lol). Although this chat can be a lot of fun, it’s not the most advanced, and unfortunately, you can’t edit or delete posts. If you need to do so, please contact me via email at billakosmodelhorses@gmail.com. Be sure to use the same username when you leave a message so others can identify you! Please be kind and respectful to the other chatters. While it’s possible no one will join the conversation, I’m determined to create a fun community of model horse lovers. I will be announcing the dates in the Stable Stories and I will send an email to those who subscribed in the mailing list. Right now it is open until 30 November 2024</p>
