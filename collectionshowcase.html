 <h3>Collection Showcase #3</h3>
            <p class="date">Published on 3 October 2024</p>

      
<p>Happy Spooktober! Today, I will be showing you one model from each of Peter Stone’s scales!</p>

<p>First, we have an adorable Chip horse on the Quarter Horse mold. I acquired this model from a Stablemate lot, and unfortunately, I don’t have much information on when it was produced or how limited it is.</p>

<p>Next is the Pebbles scale! I found this beautiful Warmblood at a great price, and I couldn’t resist buying it. I believe it was a regular run in the early 2000s, but I’m not completely sure.</p>

<p>The last and largest scale is the Stone (1:9). I have two Stone horses, and today I’ll show you Cutter. He’s on the ISH (Ideal Stock Horse) mold, and he was a regular run released in 2002.</p>

            <h3>Collection Showcase #2</h3>
            <p class="date">Published on 22 September 2024</p>

      
<p>In the first collection showcase I showed you my first model horse and my first Breyer stablemates. Today I will introduce you to the first 2 traditional horses I ever got.</p>

<p>My first Traditionals were a New Year's gift in 2022. In Greece, many families don’t open gifts on December 25th but wait until January 1st, after the new year begins. That’s when I opened mine, and the first traditional horse I saw was Catch Me! I was completely shocked at how big he was. I wasn’t expecting a plastic horse to be that large, since I was only used to Schleichs and Stablemates. Then I opened Theo, the horse I had been most excited about. Owning a Traditional horse was something I had wanted for a long time. In 2020, I discovered the hobby and Breyer horses, and I really wanted to be part of it. Unfortunately, being in Europe meant I had to spend a lot to get them from the US, so I gave up on the idea for a while. Before Christmas in 2021, my dad asked me what I wanted for the holidays, and I mentioned that a Breyer horse would be amazing, but I couldn’t find any in Europe. Later that day, he easily found a store in Germany that sold them (I felt pretty silly for not finding it myself!) and told me to pick two. For my first models, I chose Theo, whom I adored, and I specifically wanted a sport or warmblood horse to start with so I chose Catch Me.</p>

<p>Catch me was released in 2019 and he is a regular run model.</p>

<p>Theo was released in 2021  and he is also a regular run model.</p>

            <h3>Collection Showcase #1</h3>
            <p class="date">Published on 10 September 2024</p>

            <p> Welcome to the first collection showcase! In this series, I’ll be sharing my models, explaining how and where I got them, along with some additional interesting details about each one. </p>

<p>For the first showcase, I decided to show you my first ever Schleich (my first model horse ever), and my first stablemates that started my love for Breyer horses.</p>

<p>My first ever model horse was a Schleich Friesian. I don’t remember exactly when I got it, but I do recall being at a toy store near my house, where there was a stand filled with Schleich animals, including horses. After picking up that Friesian, I started buying more both to collect and to play with. Schleichs became my favorite childhood toy, and since then I have collected many. While I don’t plan to feature them all here, I might share some of the ones that hold special meaning to me.</p>

<p>The next model is my first ever Breyer horse! It was sometime around 2017 and I was out with my family when i entered a hobby store. They had some Stablemates on display for just €2, and they immediately caught my eye. I spent a bit of time looking at them, unsure which one to choose, but eventually, I decided on the Hanoverian gelding. When we sat down to eat at a restaurant, I unpacked the horse and was truly amazed with its quality. I had expected the figure to be made of soft plastic, but it was much sturdier and of far better quality than I imagined. I was so impressed that I went straight back to the store and bought a few more! </p>

<p>These are the other Stablemates that were available in the store. I don’t quite remember which ones I bought on the day I found the Hanoverian gelding, as I ended up revisiting the store a few months later and purchased the rest!</p>

<p>As you can see I have played a lot with these horses.</p>

<p>Thank you all for reading that, if you like it please let me know in the comment box. In the next showcase I will show you the first 2 traditional horses I ever got! </p>
