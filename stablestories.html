    <p>Hey everyone! I've been a bit inactive here for a while. I was preparing an update post, but then the exam period started and I didn’t have time to finish it. However, I’ll have some time soon and will probably post it then.</p>

    <h3>Collector Club store, Rambler and sneak peak</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 27 April 2025</p>
    <p>Hey guys! When Breyer announced the 2025 Collector Club, they mentioned that they would make an exclusive store just for the members. After that, we heard nothing about it and it made me believe that they would just cancel this plan. However, one or two weeks ago, they opened this store and it featured some club exclusive models such as Troubadour, Shelby, Santino and some more that you can see in the image down below. Moreover, they made Collector Club merchandise with a tumbler, a pin and a bag. This is very interesting for me as I am really curious to see what models they will put in and if they will announce it or put them at random times.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/mDFzsB6R/31.png" width="600" height="400"></center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>In the past week, they also showed us this year's classic scale gambler’s choice and I have to admit that I LOVE every single variation of it. This mold is amazing. The limit per member is 3 instead of 1, which I think is great for international collectors like me, as they can save a lot on shipping if they want more than one model!</p>
<center>

</center>
    <p>I really want one of these horses and I am still thinking of getting 1 Santino from the CC store, 1 Rambler, and 1 CC pin but I am not sure yet. I will think about it for a bit.</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>This is the sneak peek for April that Breyer sent to the newsletter:</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/T3CWjkD8/mail.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>There are many speculations regarding this model. They said that this is for CC members, but it could be anything from a special run (which I highly doubt as we got Rambler this month), a web special or even this year's CC Appreciation event because this is a glossy model. I guess we will have to see.</p>
    <p>Before closing this post, I wanted to inform you that I moved the Paddock Chat and you can now find it in the main menu on every page. I moved the Archive page to the Horseshoe menu and it is now accessible from this page (Stable Stories) on the top. Have a wonderful day :)</p>

    <h3>News</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 2 April 2025</p>
    <p>Hello! I have been quite absent in the previous weeks, and there are a lot of things to cover. Starting off with BreyerMidwest that was held on the 28th-30th of March, we saw in person a lot of the BreyerFest Special Runs and limited editions. My favourites were Hats Off to You and this year's online exclusive Hoopla! Volunteers also received this year's Ambassador's model, done on the Duende mold. The name is ¡Salud! and so far, we got two of the three colorways, leaving the last one to be revealed during BreyerFest.</p>
<center>
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/tg4RXsQG/B-EV-10472-Salud-Black-L-1024x1024.webp" width="400" height="400">
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/3wf8W3Y4/B-EV-10472-Salud-Grey-L-1024x1024.webp" width="400" height="400">
</center>
    <p>Out of these two, I like the black one the most as it reminds me of Oreo cookies.</p>
    <p>Speaking of Duende, the latest Exotic Destination release was a place in Spain called Mallorca. I have to admit that it is not my favourite and thus, I would not purchase it if selected, even though I see why many people love it.</p>
<center>

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/hPD5ZT9n/IMG_7690.jpg" width="400" height="400">
</center>
    <p>EDIT: I saw some in-person pictures, and I really like it. The images do not do justice to this model, unfortunately. The dapples look amazing, and I love how the mane and tail start a bit more gray on top and gradually turn black as they go down.</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>Regarding my show, I have been actively accepting more and more showers, and right now, there are over 60 entrants and 1,400 entries, which is incredible. The deadline is on the 7th of April, so make sure to enter before that so I have time to accept you.</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>Yesterday, it was April the 1st, and as always, Breyer had a fun surprise for us. They made Pal O' Mine into a model on the Nikolas mold! It is very cute and such a fun idea, and I believe it will end up being in the BreyerFest silent auction or even live? I guess we will have to see.</p>
<center>

</center>
    <p>EDIT: After writing this, Breyer announced that they would offer a model on the Nikolas mold with Pal O' Mine’s colors to three lucky winners of the draw. It will be free for the collectors who get it. They also showed another round of the April Fools Stablemates. I really like the Arabian Mare and Georgio!</p>

    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/gkgBCjDZ/IMG_7707.webp" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>Peter Stone also did a very fun trick this year. They created a model with only horse heads! They said that this would be part of the DAH. The funniest thing is that they allowed one lucky and fast collector to actually buy this model and choose the colorway!</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Vk5HmwGH/IMG_7702.webp" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>For March, this is the sneak peek they sent out to collector members:</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/9FsywjXk/IMG_7711.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>This is the VIP swag pack this year. It's not my cup of tea. There is nothing that interests me except the little pins. What are those colors on these molds? Imagine if they have variations for the limited runs and Celebration Horse. Is there a blue variation of Get This Party Started? Because the markings match the real model!</p>

    <p>I also got my Online Traditional Access ticket today.</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>The second release for the Vintage Club is now on sale, and it is this beautiful blue pinto pair.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/4yJBMRHP/IMG_2928.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>Last but not least, the essay contest winners were announced, and the winner was Cash. This means that his model will be made into a Regular Run later this year.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/HWqwv7Fx/cash-model-1024x1024.webp" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>The runners-up were Thiarnain and Skip to My Lulu. I would suggest visiting www.breyerhorses.com/blogs/news/meet-the-2024-breyer-essay-contest-winners for more information on the three winners!</p>

    <p>In the last post, I mentioned the arrival of the most limited horse in my collection. It was stuck in customs, and it was released on Monday, meaning that I will have him tomorrow! Sunrise on the Reaping, on the other hand, had a delay, but I got it, and I really enjoy it. The lore of The Hunger Games is one of my favourite things, and it is very fun to learn more about it.</p>
    <p>Oof, this was a long post. I hope you liked reading it :)</p>

    <h3>BreyerMidwest, BF tickets, show & book</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 18 March 2025</p>
    <p>Hello! Today I will talk about many things I have on my mind! First of all, BreyerMidwest is this weekend, which is very exciting because we will see some BreyerFest special runs and limited editions in person. Of course, for people who are lucky to be there in Kansas, this is not the most exciting part, but for me, it is (I just realised that we will also see the volunteer model for 2025!). Moreover, BreyerFest tickets will go on sale tomorrow. There is a discounted price until 30 of April, so don't forget to get yours before that.</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>Stormy Strike made a tier list for all the BF models, and this is how I ranked them. Hats off to you, definitely in the special category with the cute Fjord stablemate.</p>

    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>Last week I posted my Online Model Horse Show, and so far, there are more than 40 showers and 900 entries, which is very exciting. I took a peek at the OOAK classes, and there were 2 entries so far. The one I saw was a horse I didn't know existed, but it is a very cool blank ASB foal that was supposed to be flockie rocking model, meaning that there is no mane/tail. If you haven't seen the show, the deadline to enter is April 9th.</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>The most limited horse I have ever had is currently in customs, and I can't wait for it to come. I will definitely show it to you once it arrives. It will probably be out in 3-4 days, and I was thinking of opening it on my birthday, which is on March 29th. I don't believe I will be able to wait, but who knows.</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>Tomorrow is also a great day because the new Hunger Games book will be released! I have already preordered it, and I will have it in my hands in just a few hours (it's almost midnight right now).</p>
    <p>I hope you have a wonderful day :)</p>

    <h3>Sneak Peak: February</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 1 March 2025</p>
    <p>Hi everyone! Yesterday, Breyer sent out the monthly newsletter to Collector Club members, which included a sneak peek of the model that will be offered to members in March. Here is the image:</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/15hLCBJ7/IMG_7666.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>This one reminds me of sand. I’m guessing that it will be the next model in the Exotic Destinations series and will represent a city or country well known for its beaches or a popular summer travel destination.</p>
    <p>Have a great day :)</p>

    <h3>Updates</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 28 February 2025</p>
    <p>Hello! I haven’t posted anything here for a while, even though I had some free time to do so. I guess I just wasn’t that motivated. However, I have been doing other things in my life, such as going out with my friends and having fun with my dogs. Another exciting thing for me is that I went skiing for the first time! At first, I took a one hour lesson, and then my friends took me to a slope. I was very scared, but I managed to go down with only four falls! It was extremely fun, and by the end of the day, I was actually doing great for my first time. I felt more confident and was able to turn much better. Two weeks later, we decided to go again, and last Wednesday, I was back on the slopes! This time, everything was much better. I had a lot more balance and control compared to the first time. The only downside was that at some point, there was mist, which made it even harder for me.</p>
    <p>Regarding model horses, I purchased a very limited edition horse from a seller on Facebook, but it hasn’t arrived yet. It was quite an expensive model, so I decided that if I got this one, I wouldn’t be buying any other models this year (except for the Celebration Horse and maybe Hats Off to You). I might still end up getting another model if it’s something I just can’t pass up, like an extremely beautiful Collector Club release.</p>
    <p>Moreover, I started making another medallion of a braided warmblood horse. It’s still in the very early stages:</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/QtZ4xpLB/IMG-2544.jpg" width="300" height="400"></center>
    <p>Last but not least, I really want to start a series of online model horse shows on omhps.com, and I might begin working on it very soon.</p>
    <p>As always, I hope you liked this post. Bye :)</p>

    <h3>Maddox is here but will he be here??</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 7 February 2025</p>
    <p>Hey everyone. Today, Breyer released Maddox, the first Collector Club special run for 2025. I have a few things to say about this model. I really like the dapple gray color, and this mold is spectacular. However, I decided not to get him for 4 reasons, which are the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>I would like to save the $180 that I would have to spend on Maddox ($90 + $55 for shipping + $35 for customs/import taxes). This will help me with my 2025 goals (1. Getting my first Artist Resin, 2. Acquiring a Connoisseur model, 3. Getting a Breyer with fewer than 100 pieces) as I will have more money to put into these models.</li>
    <li>This mold is very long and quite tippy, and right now, I don't have much space, so I wouldn't know where to put it.</li>
    <li>Even though I like this model, it's not something I absolutely must have. As I mentioned, I don’t have much space, and I want to limit my purchases this year to more exclusive and rarer pieces.</li>
    <li>The Breyer warehouse has been a mess in the last couple of months, and I wouldn’t like a random model surprise after waiting for a month for my Maddox.</li>
</ul>
<center>

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/JnQ8NSTv/maddox-club-model-breyer-841694-1240x998.webp" width="400" height="400">
</center>
    <p>I will say it again. I really can't understand what Breyer is thinking with the free domestic shipping. It’s harming international collectors. I have seen many people complaining in the comments about this issue. It is extremely unfair for a model to include the domestic shipping cost in its price while making international buyers pay even more. That was the reason why I didn’t join the Vintage Club, and unless I really love a model, I am probably not going to get it.</p>
    <p>Speaking of the Vintage Club, look at this cute release that is based on the Walter Farley series! Inferno comes with a really cute vintage blanket and a book!</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/d3tY4np1/xuigwuuemr30riift6ig.png" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>All in all, I am not getting Maddox unless I change my mind before he sells out/retire. I am finally free from my exams (which, unfortunately, did not end well) and can rest before the next semester starts! I hope you have a wonderful day :)</p>

    <h3>Crystal, Prague and new Schleich scale</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 5 February 2025</p>
    <p>Hello collectors. Today I will talk about some new Breyer models and I will show you some extremely exciting news about Schleich! First of all, this is the last remaining BreyerFest Limited Edition for this year, and it's, of course, the crystal model. They named it Standing Ovation, and it's the crystal version of the American Saddlebred mold. I like it, and it could be a great souvenir to remember this milestone for the company. I haven't yet decided what I am going to purchase this year, and I have to put a lot of thought into it because there are many exceptional models I like this year, and it will probably be very expensive...</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/W4WDBc7s/Standing-Ovation-R.webp" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>Next on the line is Prague (the latest addition to the Exotic Destination Series)! I have many things to say about this one. I love these series just because I love visiting other countries, and when I see a model that is made/named after a place I have been to, I really want it. That is the case with Prague, as I visited this town in December. It was extremely beautiful, and I think the model fits the theme quite a bit. The dapple gray coat looks very wintery, like snow, and Prague is one of the best Christmas destinations.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/NMqYnNrd/Prague-Bothsides-2048x2048.webp" width="800" height="400"></center>
    <p>Here are some photos I took while I was there!</p>
<center>
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/66SBRbT8/IMG-1192.jpg" width="300" height="400">
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/x1Lj9Gfc/IMG-1219.jpg" width="300" height="400">

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/gkXkTF1y/IMG-1391.jpg" width="300" height="400">
</center>
    <p>Besides the model, there was something else I wanted to talk about. I might sound negative, but there is something that needs to be done. When they opened the club subscriptions, they announced an increase in the models but with free DOMESTIC ONLY shipping. What about international buyers? We have to pay extra for the shipping, which is something I understand as it is more expensive, but the problem is that we pay the extra price that otherwise would be the domestic shipping. What I mean is that on top of the price increase (for the "free" shipping), we have to pay around 60-70 USD more! That is very unfair, and they did the same with the web special, and I am afraid they will do this with Collector Club models as well. I really want Breyer to do something about this because it is ridiculous to increase the price for international collectors with no bonus at all. I think this is bad for U.S. collectors as well, as they can't add a Stablemate in order to get a bigger box for their model since they would have to pay extra shipping.</p>

    <p>Big news for Schleich! They are going to introduce a new horse collection in 1:12 scale. How amazing is that? They announced this at a toy exhibition in Germany, and modellpferdeversand.de shared this information with us on their blog. As they mentioned, the models are planned to come out late in 2025, and there is no information on the price yet. I believe they will be around 30 USD. These are the five horses they revealed there. My favorite is the braided warmblood on the left.</p>

    <p>Thank you for joining me on another blog post! I hope you enjoy the work I am doing here. Right now, I am very excited for many things, such as finishing my exams on Friday and planning some model horse related things that, if they go right, I will show them to you! :)</p>

    <h3>Seize the Day Surprise early prediction</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 3 February 2025</p>
    <p>Happy Monday! As we approach BreyerFest and many models have been revealed, I think it's time to show you which models are currently on my list and which molds have been eliminated for the Seize the Day Surprise. I won’t go through every mold because that would take forever, but I will make a list of the remaining ones. Here is an image with all of them:</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/nL0H0kh9/IMG-0530.jpg" width="1200" height="400"></center>
    <p>The ones marked in red have been eliminated for various reasons. For example, some are very old and unpopular, while others have been or will be released in 2025 as regular runs, special runs, limited editions, club models, etc.</p>
    <p>The remaining molds are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Anamar</li>
    <li>Andalusian Mare</li>
    <li>Ashquar</li>
    <li>Boomerang</li>
    <li>Bouncer</li>
    <li>Brighty</li>
    <li>Cantering Warmblood</li>
    <li>Vermeer</li>
    <li>Georg</li>
    <li>Goffret</li>
    <li>Gypsy Vanner</li>
    <li>Icelandic</li>
    <li>Kennebec Count</li>
    <li>Lipizzaner Mare</li>
    <li>Lipizzaner Stallion</li>
    <li>Marabella</li>
    <li>Mangalarga Marchador</li>
    <li>Marwari</li>
    <li>Missouri Fox Trotter</li>
    <li>Troubadour</li>
    <li>Mustang Mare</li>
    <li>Mustang Stallion</li>
    <li>Newsworthy</li>
    <li>Nokota</li>
    <li>Astrid</li>
    <li>Othello</li>
    <li>Paso Fino</li>
    <li>Peruvian Paso</li>
    <li>Rain</li>
    <li>Ruffian</li>
    <li>Shagya Arabian</li>
    <li>Shannondell</li>
    <li>Zafirah</li>
    <li>Duende</li>
    <li>Spirit</li>
    <li>Constantia</li>
    <li>Firefly</li>
    <li>Strapless</li>
    <li>Susecion</li>
    <li>Totilas</li>
    <li>Weather girl</li>
    <li>Valegro</li>
    <li>Vanner Mare</li>
    <li>Carrick</li>
    <li>Idocus</li>
    <li>Welsh Mare</li>
    <li>Wixom</li>
    <li>Zippo Pine Bar.</li>
</ul>
    <p>Some of these are very unlikely to be the surprise model, but I haven’t crossed them out yet. I don’t currently have a top 10, but there are specific molds that could be perfect for the Seize the Day Surprise. As Breyer reveals more models throughout the year, I will continue to remove molds from the list and update it. In the end, just before BreyerFest, I will share my final predictions! :)</p>

    <h3>More Breyerfest reveals so far</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 30 January 2025</p>
    <p>Hey! I have been very inactive lately, and I really want to change that. I will finish my exams on the 7th of February, and I will have more time for model horses! I am also thinking of hosting my first online model horse show for collectability. Regarding BreyerFest, they have revealed all the Special Runs. I will make a post with my ranking list.</p>
<center><h3><span style="color: #2c789c;">Limited Editions</span></h3></center>
    <p>This year's classic scale limited edition is a portrait horse! It's called "Game Day Surprise." I love this model, and I think the accessory is very cute!</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/8PQkr7pn/B-EV-10448-Game-Day-Surprise-with-Sash-R-1024x1024.webp" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>Beau N’ Arrow is another limited edition based on a vaulting horse. I can't wait to see him in the covered arena live with his squad!</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/T1mR4699/B-EV-10449-Beau-N-Arrow-R-1024x1024.webp" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>This is the Best of BreyerFest - Series 6 models! These models are based on the ones from BreyerFest 2015 Vive La France: Parfait, C’est Bon!, Truffles, Crème de la Crème, and Tout Suite.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/NjQgpZr6/B-EV-10462-Best-of-Breyer-Fest-Box-Silo-Web-448x360.webp" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>The little Fjord is the one I want the most. Unfortunately, I am not going to get this set as I have a limit on the money I am spending on Breyer's website, and I would prefer to get something else.</p>
<center><h3><span style="color: #2c789c;">In-Person Special Runs</span></h3></center>
    <p>Yolo is a weird name for a model, but here is a dapple gray Vanner. I like this one, but not as much as others and probably wouldn't choose it if I was going to Breyerfest in person.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/pLVHD8gk/YOLO-L-1024x1024.webp" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>"Life's a Journey" is this year's non-equine special run model! It's a Collie with a blue merle coat. I didn’t know what merle was until I got my real life dog earlier this year, which is merle.</p>
<center>
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/L5dSfWpZ/Lifes-A-Journey-L-1024x1024.webp" width="400" height="400">
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/RCf49v71/Lifes-A-Journey-R-1024x1024.webp" width="400" height="400">
</center>
    <p>The bandana is extremely cute, and I’m lowkey glad that it's not available online, as it would make the preference form even harder for me.</p>
<center><h3><span style="color: #2c789c;">In-Person / Online SR</span></h3></center>
    <p>To the Ties That Bind Us is the decorator special run, and I really like it! I love that they used the same pattern as the 75th Anniversary models with the silhouettes of the different molds. The blue color is really nice, and I am seriously considering putting it in my preference form.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/wjWdFMzz/To-the-Ties-That-Bind-Us-1024x1024.webp" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>This year's surprise model is called Seize the Day Surprise. I will post my current prediction list soon and update it regularly because there are a lot of possibilities right now.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Yq6rNtj2/111124-BF25-Seize-The-Day-Surprise-logo-final-KM-1024x1024.webp" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>The next special run is my favorite! Hats Off to You is the vintage model SR, and I am absolutely in love with it. I love this mold, and the color is amazing. It comes with two hats: a regular western hat and a PARTY HAT!!! How amazing is that?</p>
<center>
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/xCNYX2W2/Hats-Off-R-1024x1024.webp" width="400" height="400">
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Xvz4NJ1L/Hats-off-Party-L-1024x1024.webp" width="400" height="400">
</center>
    <p>This will be my top choice for sure.</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>Last but not least, we got a model on the Criollo mold. Future is Bright is a beautiful palomino with a lot of dapples! I really like this version with the long mane.</p>
<center>

</center>
<center><h3><span style="color: #2c789c;">Online Limited Editions</span></h3></center>
    <p>Hooplah is this year's online traditional model. I really like this model, and I might add it to my cart. I hope there will be a matte/glossy split on this one, as I really want it in glossy.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/bNh8w4g7/Hoopla-L-1024x1024.webp" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>The online exclusive stablemate that I will definitely get is Shindig. I am not in love with the color, but I quite like it. I am sure that there will be a fun variation on this one.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/TYJxLQHp/Shindig-R-1024x1024.webp" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>While writing this, they revealed the plush. Meet Party Pal!</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/wxsTvXpm/B-EV-10455-Party-pals-1024x1024.webp" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>I believe that there will be micro runs of 75 pieces for many of the models. I hope you enjoyed today’s post, and again, I am very sorry for my inactivity. After my exams, I will definitely be more active. Have a nice evening :)</p>

    <h3>Breyerfest reveals so far</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 13 January 2025</p>
<center><h3><span style="color: #2c789c;">Event Stablemates</span></h3></center>
    <p>This year, I love all the stablemates. If I had to put them in order, I would say:</p>
<ul>
    <li>1. Bellini</li>
    <li>2. Cava</li>
    <li>3. Prosecco</li>
    <li>4. Mimosa</li>
</ul>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/PfphJQmk/B-EV-10460-Break-Out-the-Bubbles-box-1024x1024.webp" width="600" height="400"></center>
    <p>I will definitely search for the polo pony (Bellini) and maybe Cava. These names are very fun and fit the theme very well! I also love that they did realistic colors this time as I did not like last year's stablemates</p>
<center><h3><span style="color: #2c789c;">Limited Editions</span></h3></center>
    <p>Belesema Sapphire is the first portrait model of a horse that Breyer revealed. It's a chestnut mare.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/w38wjpD3/B-EV-10447-Belesema-Sapphire-R-1024x1024.webp" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>I am not sure, but I might purchase her. I really like this mold, and I believe that there might be a variation with all 3 versions of it.</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>Halcyonia Night Life is the second LE. To be honest, this model doesn't excite me. I am not a huge fan of black models as I find them a bit boring. In the images, there are some dapples, which is nice, but still, I don't see this model and say wow.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/WzJ9V3FQ/B-EV-10445-Halcyonia-Night-Life-L-1024x1024.webp" width="400" height="400"></center>
<center><h3><span style="color: #2c789c;">In-Person Special Runs</span></h3></center>
    <p>The reveal party started with "Get This Party Started"! This pinto Connemara is only available to in-person attendees, but I don't mind it as it is not my cup of tea. It's a beautiful model but not something I would want to purchase.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/fbBqj1Qg/Get-This-Party-Started-R-1024x1024.webp" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>Nothing I said about the previous model applies to this one. We got the mare and foal set "Good Times and Great Friends," and unfortunately, it is only available in person. This set is amazing, and when I saw the images, I got very excited—until I saw the availability.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/85cKyw1k/Good-Times-Great-Friends-1024x1024.webp" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>I am thinking of not getting anything during BreyerFest weekend and try for this set in the second-chance sale. I might get lucky and snag one. The gloss is amazing, and I would gladly pair them with Bolero to make a cute family.</p>
<center><h3><span style="color: #2c789c;">In-Person / Online SR</span></h3></center>
    <p>The only online-available special run we have seen so far is "Let the Good Times Roll". It's a sooty buckskin leopard Appaloosa on the Show Jumping Warmblood mold. I really like this model, and I might include it in the top of my preference list.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/sXLnbSXY/Let-the-Good-Times-Roll-L-1024x1024.webp" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>For this Special Run there could be a loose/braided mane and tail split on this one or matte/glossy split (or even both).</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>I believe that this year they will do many fun surprises with the models. There will most probably be micro runs and some very exciting variations. Breyer will continue to reveal more models in the upcoming weeks, and I will mention them here. Thank you for reading today's posts. Have a great week :)</p>

    <h3>Dogs, PC and Midas!</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 13 January 2025</p>
    <p>Happy Monday! I haven't been that active lately regarding model horses because there are many things happening in my life. First of all, I got 2 puppies! My mum wanted a poodle, but I wanted a Dachshund, and we got both of them. They are very cute, but I have to watch them and take care of them. I named mine Pretzel, and here she is:</p>

</center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>Something I wanted to talk about but did not have the time for is the Premier Club. I was thinking of joining but decided not to in the end. This lineup is amazing, and I love all 3 models. The thing I like the most is the choice of braided/loose on Rowan and the matte/glossy choice on Cosimo. Moreover, the chance to get the micro-run gray Winnifred made me think about it a bit more.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/L84bD672/IMG-2158.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>I finally found one of my top grails in Europe! I finally got Midas and I can't wait for him to arrive. I have been looking for one but did not want to spend a lot on shipping fees and customs. I also did not want to spend much money on models right now but when I saw Midas on eBay, I couldn't let him pass. The price was very reasonable too.</p>
    <p>I will talk about the BreyerFest reveals we have in the next post (I already posted it)...</p>

    <h3>Christmas haul 2024</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 5 January 2025</p>
    <p>Hello! Today, I’ll show you everything I got for Christmas! Some of these are models I purchased myself, while others were gifts from my family.</p>
    <p>First of all, I finally got the Stablemate wooden display barn! I chose the older version with the white and blue colors. Instead of getting an advent calendar this year, I decided to open one horse every weekend in December. On the 24th, I opened the display barn! I love the Stablemates, but my favorite is this bay Valegro!</p>

</center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>Next on the list is the polo pony! I finally found one at an amazing price. I opened this model on Christmas Day instead of New Year’s, which is when we usually exchange gifts.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/KvC0H1CZ/B06648-B8-88-B9-41-E6-BB2-E-A3-B64-D27-D1-BA.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>The next horse is this Peter Stone MiniMe Blue Granite in Glossy, which is from the Equilocity event of 2006 and I think there were 50 made.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/8c0ZDc5m/AA1-ED9-F0-6-EFC-43-CC-805-A-8847-D31-D9-EEA.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>Moving on, I got Ivy! I’ve wanted this model for a very long time, and when a seller from Germany listed one, I snagged it as fast as I could!</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/sXKn6wC8/ADA7874-E-89-CE-4354-9-CE3-6-C755-A7-EED1-E.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>Check out this amazing porcelain model that my cousin got for me in Vienna! She visited the Spanish Riding School shop just for me and picked out this stunning statue/model. It’s now proudly displayed in my model cabinet as it’s such a special piece in my collection.</p>

    <p>This year, my parents gave me Zafirah for the holidays, and I couldn’t be happier. It’s such a handsome model with incredible details. The face is especially cute!</p>

    <p>Last but not least, I finally unboxed Calista! I ordered her back in September but decided to open her on my name day (January 1st).</p>

    <h3>2nd and Winter Medallions</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 31 December 2024</p>
    <p>Welcome to the last post of 2024! At some point, I talked about my sculpting attempts, and I mentioned that I was working on another medallion. I finished it but forgot to show it to you! It’s the face of a horse. I wasn’t sure about it until I baked it! It turned out very cute, and I’m happy with how it came out in the end. This perspective was outside my comfort zone, but for the first time, I believe it’s not that bad.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/2yKMnpgG/IMG_1803.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>The next horse is the Christmas/Winter special for 2024. It is a Fjord horse with a blanket! I was originally planning to make it with a background but then decided not to. I might create a complementary piece that will connect like a puzzle and say something like “Happy Holidays” or “2024.” I’m not sure yet.</p>

</center>
    <p>EDIT: Before posting this, I actually made something that connects to the model! It includes a snowman, a tree, and the year 2024 on it.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/hjgBGBq7/IMG_1806.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>I hope you like them as much as I do! See you in 2025 :)</p>

    <h3>Collection Showcase #7</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 28 December 2024</p>
    <p>Hello Santa's little helpers! I decided to show you 3 Winter themed horses today! Two of these are some of my favorite models in my collection, and I believe you will love them as much as I do!</p>
    <p>The first one is Astrid! I got this mare from da Vinci Creations in March 2023! Fjord horses have always been one of my favorite breeds, and I had to get Astrid. The glossy version was my top choice as it makes her color really pop. Her coat is called Grå, and she has a stripe down her back plus a star on her head!</p>

    <p>Astrid was released in 2021 as part of the Premier Club. Members could choose between Matte or Glossy versions.</p>

    <p>The next horse is a stablemate Fjord I randomly have in my collection. It is from the Blind Bag Surprise Series 3.</p>

    <p>Last but not least, this is Neva!!! When he was released, I was amazed by the snowman markings. Unfortunately, I did not get him at the release, and then he sold out. In September 2023, a shop in Europe put some up for sale, and I quickly snatched one. When he arrived, I resisted the temptation to open him and waited until December 25th. It was incredibly difficult to have a model and not open it, but I managed, and it made Christmas feel even more special!!</p>

    <p>Neva was the Winter Classic for 2022, and you could only get him directly from Breyer.</p>

    <h3>2025 Releases (RR, Clubs)</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 26 December 2024</p>
    <p>Hello! As you might have seen, Breyer has revealed some more 2025 Premier and Stablemate Club models. Moreover, someone leaked the regular run releases from the dealers' catalog. I am going to show them to you and, because there are many, I will only comment on those that made an impression on me (good or bad).</p>
<center><p><span style="color: #2c789c;">Stablemates</span></p></center>
    <p>There are two new sets and a new unicorn mystery bag series! I don’t mind the jewels (deco set) or the unicorns, but the bigger set… OMG. I have been waiting for this Fjord forever! I love almost every horse, and I will buy it for sure!</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/65hj80Xv/0C1F2FFA-9BDC-4399-83F1-B35F824BF526.png" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
<center><p><span style="color: #2c789c;">Anniversary Models</span></p></center>
    <p>There are four anniversary models! Three are for Breyer’s 75th birthday, and they match my prediction for the molds they would use. We still have to see the other two, which will be in the mid-year releases. Regarding the silver horse, it is a commemorative model for the 85th anniversary of the American Quarter Horse Association.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/XJFx4KLX/38C4D151-CC40-4568-8C18-924AED0AC614.png" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>I’m not a huge fan of any of these models, and I don’t know if I will end up getting one.</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
<center><p><span style="color: #2c789c;">Other Regular Runs</span></p></center>
    <p>Breyer finally made a Big Lex model! I really like it, but even though it’s something that excites me, I don’t know if I want it in my collection. As you can see, there is another palomino mustang and a pony on last year’s Welsh Cob mold.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/02vX54Lv/5DAA157C-E060-428B-99D1-0A9C7BAE6FE7.png" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
<center><p><span style="color: #2c789c;">Halloween, Holiday, and… A BULL REGULAR RUN!!</span></p></center>
    <p>When I saw the images, I only focused on the horses, and the information that there is a longhorn bull did not register in my brain! When I realized it, I was shocked! I really want this model and can’t wait for it to be available here!</p>
    <p>As for the Holiday horse, I love the mold they used (Flash) and the coat, but the costume is not my favorite. Regarding the Halloween one… I hate it. I have arachnophobia, and I just can’t see it. They used a mold I love, but the spider as a marking is just disappointing and disgusting to me. Of course, many people will disagree, but I’m not looking forward to seeing it everywhere in October.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/2Sc0wS3j/7E1CC828-27F7-4E15-B996-C65CB28EFB92.png" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
<center><p><span style="color: #2c789c;">Premier Club</span></p></center>
    <p>I did mention Roman in a previous post, but not only did they reveal his color, they revealed a mane/tail/breed variation! This is from Breyer’s website: “Members can choose between a hardy, loose-maned Highland Pony stallion or a sleek, braided British Riding Pony mare! Kelly spent many hours getting their details just right—from hardy conformation, an archetypal cresty neck, and a thick, full mane for our Highland, to a finer body, feminine expression, and perfect turnout for our British Riding Pony. Both are moving at the trot with strength and ease.” The last reveal is Cosimo, an Italian Murgese stallion sculpted by Sarah Minkiewicz-Breunig.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/6Q8Y1xGr/809F8F6B-3C8E-437C-9E73-465D52778E21.png" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>I don’t think Breyer has ever revealed all three models for the Premier Club. Rowan has to be my favorite, and if I joined, I would choose the braided version. I might be able to find one secondhand. All three Premier club models are amazing, and I would gladly join the club if it wasn’t so expensive.</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
<center><p><span style="color: #2c789c;">Stablemates Club</span></p></center>
    <p>For this club, we got another compulsory to buy model and the special run for 2025. Alana is the black tobiano pinto Tennessee Walking Horse. Harbinger is the Pegasus! This is the groundbreaking model Breyer was talking about earlier, and I think it’s fabulous. Wings fit this mold extremely well!</p>

</center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>I saw this message from Triple Mountain and thought it would be good to share:</p>
    <p>“We know everyone is excited, but keep in mind that the new releases will be available for a whole year, and there is no scarcity (other than if there's a Flagship model). Just as you're no longer excited about Morganquest Native Sun or Marc of Charm, this year's models will be around long after the excitement ebbs. I hope that will reduce the anxiety some collectors create for themselves around this time of year.”</p>
    <p>Thank you for reading today’s post! Bye :)</p>

    <h3>Tannenbaum -2024 Holiday Surprise</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 23 December 2024</p>
    <p>Hello! Exciting news: Breyer announced this year’s holiday surprise model, and it’s on the Fell Pony mold! The model, named Tannenbaum, comes in four colors: blue, red, green, and coal. It’s priced at $135, with a total run of 3,025 pieces, including just 24 in the rare coal color. I’m curious if the three “common” colors will have different run numbers. As much as I love the design, I decided to pass on this one, even though members get free shipping. Honestly, I might have been tempted to grab it if I hadn’t bought Ivy just five days ago!</p>

    <h3>Collection Showcase #6</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 19 December 2024</p>
    <p>Hey Collectors! Welcome to Collection Showcase number 6!! Today I will show you 2 traditional horses and 1 classic that I have in my collection.</p>
    <p>Starting off with a classic, I have a regular run on the Rearing Stallion mold, originally created in 1965 by Chris Hess. I chose this model because I’ve always liked the Traditional Fighting Stallion and I thought that the silver bay coat looks great on this mold. As I’m writing this, I just realized something! The Classic mold isn’t exactly the same as the Traditional! I always thought they just shrunk the Traditional mold, but it turns out they didn’t.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/TPV6bYCS/IMG_1671.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>The second horse is the Traditional Fighting Stallion, created in 1961 by Chris Hess. This stunning glossy chestnut pinto model was originally made for Breyer’s 70th Anniversary in 2020 and was later glossed for the Collector Club Appreciation Event!</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/05c9ZjP1/IMG_1663.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>I found this guy on eBay, and my parents got him for my 19th birthday. Breyer hasn’t published an official run number for this model, but while reading a list from the Boo Photo Show, I discovered that there might be fewer than 160 made, which is insane!</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>The last model I’m going to show you is a more modern one, Adamek! He’s a gorgeous regular-run Akhal-Teke released in 2022. I’m including him here because I got him along with the Classic Rearing Stallion. What I love most about him is the mapping on his head. There aren’t many regular runs with that level of detail.</p>

    <p>This mold is incredible and so dynamic. The only downside? It takes up a lot of space!</p>
    <p>I hope you liked todays models! Byee :)</p>

    <h3>New models and Updates!</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 17 December 2024</p>
    <p>Happy Tuesday! I’m so sorry that I haven't been very active lately, but there are many things happening in my life! I was in Prague, and when I came back, I had to complete an assignment for my uni. Then, I had show jumping competitions and yesterday, I also had a test for uni as well! As you can imagine, I haven’t had time to upload anything here even though there were some very interesting and exciting things happening regarding Breyer!</p>
    <p>First of all, 2024 Premier and Stablemates Club members can purchase the last releases. For Premier, it’s Bandalero with the very cute laying foal bonus Stablemate, Enya. For Stablemates, members can purchase Augustus and the optional model Hadley and Holden that comes with a gambler's choice foal!</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>Regarding the 2025 Stablemates Club, we got two more reveals for next year! On the left, we have Spencer, a very beautiful Appaloosa, and on the right is Javier, which will be a matte-glossy split!</p>
<center>
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/qqNnkp9D/8225FE53-5BDA-479D-9CAD-C8ED49CF6DA9.webp" width="400" height="400">

</center>
    <p>I still don’t know if I will join the Stablemates Club. The reveals so far are okay, but except for Madonna, the others don’t excite me that much.</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>WinterFest! Where is it, though? Breyer last year introduced a new holiday event that took place online in December. It wasn’t big or anything, but it was very fun, and I personally really enjoyed it. There were workshops, two special runs, and my personal favorite was the broadcast. It was cozy to watch it during the Christmas break, and I was looking forward to it this year as well! This was not the case… My theory is that it wasn’t very profitable, as the special runs both showed up this year in Breyer’s online store. Even though there won’t be any WinterFest this year (probably), I really hope they will offer us a broadcast.</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>We finally got the winter decoration for 2024, but with a twist! In previous years, this model was offered for purchase to the lucky Collector Club members who got picked in a draw. This year, they decided to let everyone get it, meaning Courchevel is available to all members. It is a first-come, first-serve model. The run number is unknown, which is why there is some disappointment among collectors, as they believe that the $155 price tag is very high if the run number is large (making it a bit less limited). On the other hand, the shipping is free, but this doesn’t apply to international members like me.</p>
<center>
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/CM2kcfq3/C5448B8D-A9B1-4D8C-B910-20F976FD7C4F.webp" width="400" height="400">
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/L6Zfw6kn/E82A638A-F1D7-4AE0-8DB5-678B8DA9D844.webp" width="400" height="400">
</center>
    <p>I can’t hide that I’m very dissatisfied with Breyer, as I believe they should not include free shipping in the price if it doesn’t apply to international collectors too! It’s very unfair for us to have to pay extra for a model’s price that includes shipping to the US and then have to pay extra for international shipping.</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>Enough negativity! Yesterday, Breyer announced another sculpture for the Premier Club next year. This is Rowan, "a delightful Highland Pony stallion sculpted by Kelly Sealey of the United Kingdom. Kelly spent many hours getting his details just right—from his hardy conformation to his delightful personality. His archetypal cresty neck sports a thick, full mane, and he's moving at the trot with strength and ease."</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/9MXVk0H7/rowan-shopify_1235x994.webp" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>I really like this mold, and I can't wait to see the final piece!!</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>This is my horse! He is in the competition facility stable, and I think he looked very sweet. We entered the 1.10 class on Thursday so he could get used to the indoor arena that hosted the event, and on Saturday, we jumped the 1.15-1.20 course!</p>

</center>
    <p>Last but not least, I finally found a Polo pony in a good price here in Europe. I have some other models waiting to be opened as well, but I will wait until Christmas or new year to free them. I will show them to you later!!</p>
    <p>Have a nice day, everyone! :)</p>

    <h3>75th Anniversary Lonesome Glory</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 8 December 2024</p>
    <p>Hello or Ahoj in Czech (I’m currently in Prague!!). Horse Lover from the Breyer Forums posted a photo that she found on the latest Young Rider magazine!</p>

    <h3>A little bit of everything</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 1 December 2024</p>
    <p>Hi everyone! In Tuesday, I visited Germany for three days! It wasn’t a "for fun" trip but rather for my parents' work. Still, I had an amazing time exploring the cities of Nuremberg and Munich. There were Christmas markets with Glühwein and hot cocoa, which made the experience even more better. I’m thinking I should really start posting about the places I’ve visited. Here are some pictures I took:</p>

    <p>Regarding Breyer, while I was there, they announced a second Black Friday sale. I was a bit nervous since I’d be out when the sale happened. As I mentioned before, I really wanted to get Reykjavik and hoped there’d be a chance for him to go on sale. When the sale started and the new products appeared, I quickly scanned the listings but didn’t see him. However, Peregrine caught my eye! I didn’t want to spend money unless it was for Reykjavik, though. Even if I had wanted Peregrine, I probably wouldn’t have been fast enough as he sold out in one minute! These were all the models available:</p>

</center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>We also got another sneak peak on one of the releases of the Stablemates Club for next year. This is Mercutio and he is on the mini Othello mold!</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/QCSrGhc1/F137D78F-D78B-4061-8AF7-8E4ACB637EAE.webp" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>I really like his color and the gloss makes him look just amazing. I really want to see all the other releases and maybe I will join the sm club?? Idk...</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
<center><p><span style="color: #2c789c;">November's Sneak Peak</span></p></center>
    <p>As always, Collector Club members received a sneak peek of an upcoming model. This month, members were shown this:</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/ZnJhMCvJ/2C19D874-D8E1-4DA4-B592-2C1405E4165B.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
    <p>I believe this will be this year’s holiday web special. Some people think it might be one of the Christmas surprise models, but I doubt it. Why would they reveal it so early?</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>If you’ve checked out my mini-game, you’ll notice there are new models to catch! Feel free to recommend more horses for me to add, but make sure their images have a transparent background. I’ve also updated the search engine in Stable Stories, so you can now search for whatever you want. Plus, I added a "go to the top of the page" button to make navigation easier!</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>While in Nuremberg, I visited a store with metal figurines, and when I found the horses, they looked so familiar. It turns out they were copies of Breyer Stablemates models! I ended up buying one because it looked so cool.</p>

    <p>The last thing I wanted to mention is that my Just About Horses magazine arrived! I honestly thought I wouldn’t receive it or that it might get lost, but I was wrong. When I returned from my trip to Germany, I found it sitting on the kitchen table!</p>

    <p>I still can’t believe it’s already December. It’s time for the Advent calendars! I didn’t get myself one this year, but a kind lady at a train station in Nuremberg gave some mini chocolate ones to everyone, and I ended up getting one! Now, I have something to open every day. I hope you enjoyed this post! Have a nice day :)</p>

    <h3>Earl(y) Black Friday</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 24 November 2024</p>
    <p>Happy Sunday! As you might have heard or seen, Breyer held their early access Black Friday sale for Collector Club members. As always, there were some very exciting models that of course, sold out fast. I was really hoping there would be a Reykjavík, as he's one of my grails, but unfortunately, he wasn’t included. By the time I even got a chance to check out all the models, some had already sold out within two minutes! I was interested in Elsa, the cow, because she’s  extremely pretty, but I ultimately decided not to try for her. Another model I could have gotten is Cooper but I can find him second hand in better price!</p>

    <p>Later in Friday CC members received an email saying that they could enter for the chance to buy this years animal web spceial: "Earl is an eye-catching spotted blue roan bull with a highly-detailed white pattern and a star on his forehead.  His roan shading is dramatic and intricate!". He is limited to 1000 pieces and will cost $150.</p>

    <p>I think this guy looks very cool! I don't know if I would like him in my collection but if I get chosen ,I might decide to buy him.</p>

    <p>Last week, I visited a hobby store near my house that I knew carried some Breyer Stablemates. (It’s the same store but different location, that I found my first stablemates). As soon as I walked in, I headed straight to the section where I had previously found the Stablemates. On my way there, I was thrilled to discover an entire area dedicated to Breyer horses! While there weren’t any Traditional Breyers, I was excited to find some Stablemates sets that I’ll be featuring in an upcoming collection showcase. The most exciting discovery, though, was the Breyer Animal Collector's Guide!!</p>

    <h3>BreyerMidwest horse</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 18 November 2024</p>
    <p>Breyer has unveiled next year's BreyerMidwest horse! The featured model is a glossy version of WGC Marc of Charm and it comes with a Certificate of Authenticity. He’s priced at $175 and can be purchased online, but you will need to attend the event to pick him up in person.</p>

    <p>Interestingly, this model will be packaged in bubble wrap instead of the latest paper protection. Could this mean a shift in their packaging approach?</p>

    <h3>VC & DONKEY!!</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 16 November 2024</p>
    <p>Happy Saturday! This week has been a bit rainy here in Greece, making the weather feel so cozy and chill. Fortunately, thanks to a "holiday" (more like a protest holiday), I didn’t have to attend university, so I got to relax without worrying about classes.</p>
    <p>Yesterday, Breyer opened the Vintage Club memberships, and I’m still surprised to see that, as of now (1 day and 6 hours later), they haven’t sold out yet. The likely reason is the increase in membership slots from 1,000 to 1,200. I was planning to join, but I ended up debating with myself whether it was worth it or not. In the end, I decided not to because the cost is quite high, and reselling the releases at cost or finding someone to take over my spot might be difficult. I really don’t want to take the risk since getting a release I don’t like could cost me over $250, which is a significant amount of money. Maybe I’ll consider joining the Stablemates Club instead, but I’ll wait to see the full lineup first (last year, they revealed all the models before the memberships closed).</p>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>Peter Stone has started collaborating with various artists to create unique pieces for their best offers. This time, they invited Kylee Parks from Studio Thornrose to create a Poitou Donkey named Existential Dreads. She used the mule mold and transformed it into a detailed, adorable, hairy donkey with intricate coat details! If you’re interested in getting it, be prepared for the price! It’s already at $5,920 with 4 more days to go...</p>

    <h3>Sculpting attempts</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 15 November 2024</p>
    <p>Hello! As I mentioned in an earlier post, I'm going to share all my attempts at creating a model horse. I'm not exactly an artist, so you can imagine how things turned out! First, I downloaded Blender, a computer program for 3D design and sculpting. My first attempt at a horse was more of a strange creature that reminded me of a hippo. Unfortunately, I don’t have that one anymore, so I can’t show it to you.</p>
<center><p><span style="color: #2c789c;">Lyon</span></p></center>
    <p>Lyon was my second horse that was created in the free version of ZBrush, and he turned out a bit more successful than my previous attempt. Once I finished sculpting him, I tried animating him! Although he still looked a bit odd, I was thrilled to have created something on my own. Later, I decided to give him a pose. Since two of his legs were lifted, I had to make a stand for support, and here’s the final result:</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Cxzn0NtG/Στιγμιότυπο_οθόνης_(19).png" width="400" height="400"></center>
<center><p><span style="color: #2c789c;">"Summer horse"</span></p></center>
    <p>I started making this horse way after finishing the best model horse in the world, Lyon. I think I made the head in ZBrush but because of the free version, I had to limit the details and I decided to make the body in blender. The reason why I call it summer horse is because I started it in July/August 2023 and I never gave it a proper name. Here are some pictures of the process:</p>

</center>
<center><p><span style="color: #2c789c;">Icelandic Horse</span></p></center>
    <p>In January 2024, I had an idea to start a new 3D horse model, but this time I wanted to create it in a posed position from the beginning. I chose to make a tölting Icelandic horse since I love them so much. As usual, I didn’t quite get around to finishing it, but here’s what I’ve done so far:</p>
<center>
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/nhzBzZsQ/29.png" width="400" height="400">
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/gk43mr0W/30.png" width="400" height="400">
</center>
    <p>It wasn’t the worst start, but by this point, I realized I couldn’t do much with my current laptop. It’s a bit old and struggles to keep up, making it almost impossible to work smoothly with such a demanding program.</p>
<center><p><span style="color: #2c789c;">Other sculpting tries</span></p></center>
    <p>Over the years, I’ve also tried my hand at traditional sculpting, though I hadn’t researched the types of clay available. I experimented with regular clay, but I quickly learned that it’s tough to work with especially for a beginner like me. Here’s an attempt where I resculpted the tail and hooves for this horse:</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/9F8ZFzty/IMG_0601.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>
<center><p><span style="color: #2c789c;">Medallions</span></p></center>
    <p>After feeling pretty disappointed with my model horse attempts, I decided to try something simpler like a medallion. Thinking it would be easier, I went for regular clay again, but I ran into the same problems. Then, I switched to polymer clay, and most of my issues vanished! Polymer clay was a game changer, it didn’t make a mess, it didn’t break or crack, and since it only hardens after baking, I could set it aside for days and still rework it. This made it much easier to add details, and that shows in the final product. It may not be the most beautiful horse, but I’m confident that with practice, I can keep improving and create even better ones (I have already started my second one).</p>
<center>

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/7Z57CDmd/IMG_0603.jpg" width="400" height="400">
</center>
    <center><p>On the right it's the normal clay attempt and on the left the polymer clay one!</p></center>
    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>
    <p>My current plan is to keep making more medallions until I feel ready to start a 3D horse model again (with clay). I’d also love to make a silicone mold so I can offer them to offer to collectors, but that’s something I’ll focus on in the future. I hope you enjoyed today’s post, and I look forward to seeing you in the next one! Byee :)</p>

    <h3>Small updates</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 10 November 2024</p>
    <p>Happy Sunday! As I said in a previous blogpost, I was thinking of joining the Vintage club this year but at this point I don't know... The prices went up ($160-185) because Breyer  included the shipping cost ,but to me that is not the case. Being international means that I will have to pay approximately $60-65 for shipping plus custom fees and the total to get all the 4 releases will be around $1000. Of course I can give my spot to someone else for the ones I don't want but I don't know if it is worth it. The same happened to the other 2 clubs but I was not interested in those.</p>
    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Y0ZYrwCw/0-B9-B3619-8-B4-E-464-D-B9-F5-EAF088923-D95.png" width="400" height="400"></center>

            <h3>JAH reveals and Clubs</h3>
            <p class="date">Published on 7 November 2024</p>

<p>Yesterday, some people received their JAH magazine, and it contained some really exciting information! The part that got me most excited and a bit stressed was the Vintage Club release! One of the 2025 releases will be a clock horse (Pioneer), which is something I really want for my collection. I’m determined not to miss out on joining this club this year and will do my best to secure a spot.</p>

<center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/pLhfJQnp/E095-CAE6-D45-E-4-D9-D-91-B2-B782-BA560-D07.jpg" width="420" height="400"></center>

<p>Additionally, there was information about five releases scheduled for next year and I have some thoughts about them. Read this and you will understand what I mean:</p>

<center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/NFD4ZggF/1-CB6-FA99-4138-4-A9-C-814-C-C2-A0-A1-AB8-F45.jpg" width="400" height="400"> <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/tRN2szhb/250-F47-F6-C73-C-40-E6-BF52-C76-CE153-F8-D5.jpg" width="400" height="400"> </center>

<p>My theory is that the molds they’re talking about are the ones shown on the 75th anniversary blanket! These molds are supposed to have an anniversary in 2025. These are the molds that are shown in the blanket and their anniversary:</p>

<ul>
  <li>15 years: Esprit (2010)</li>
  <li>20 years: Smart Chic Olena (2005)</li>
  <li>25 years: Lonesome Glory (2000)</li>
  <li>25 years: American Saddlebred Stallion (2000)</li>
  <li>75 years: Western horse (1950)</li>
</ul>


    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>

<p>The Premier Club and Stablemate Club are now open, but I don’t have a lot of details on them yet. The releases I’ve seen are still the same (The mule and the Stablemate Arabian that I posted on 19 October), but I’ve heard that prices have gone up (I think for the Premier Club each model be $195, and for the Stablemate Club $30, with free shipping for US members). International members, however, might have to pay extra, making it quite expensive, so joining these clubs might not be worth it. The Stablemate Club does have an international option, though I don’t have any details on it yet because Breyer doesn’t allow viewing more information about the clubs without a 2025 Collector Club membership. Another issue with the free shipping is that you can’t add a small Stablemate or other items to have the model shipped in a larger box for extra security. I didn’t want to sound negative, but I’m really concerned that these changes could make it hard for many international collectors to join the specialty clubs, and maybe I won’t be able to join the Vintage Club.</p>

    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>

<p>The Premier Club 2024 extra Stablemate was revealed in the JAH magazine, and it’s the cutest thing ever! It’s a 50/50 matte-glossy split, and its name is Enya. I love this sculpture and hope I can get one soon!</p>

<p>Last weekend PeterStone offered some OOAKS as usual and one of them was probably one of the most beautiful horses I have ever seen! I will post about it soon. Have a great day :)</p>

<p>Welcome back to another collection showcase! Today, I have two models to share that I got from Austria, the land with no kangaroos!! There's a funny story behind how I got them. During my last year of high school, instead of studying for exams, I found myself browsing eBay for plastic ponies. That’s when I came across a seller offering both Starlight and Glossy Benelli for not that much. I couldn't decide which one I wanted more (both had the same price), but in the end, I chose Starlight.</p>

<p>She arrived about a week after I placed the order, and the seller included a sweet little note saying thank you, which made me really happy. I showed it to my dad, and he got so excited that he asked if the seller had anything else I wanted. I showed him Benelli, and he told me to go ahead and get it! My mom helped me with the purchase since I was still a minor and didn’t have my own card at the time.</p>

<p>The following week, when Benelli was due to arrive, I skipped school so I could be home to open him. (My excuse for skipping? Studying!) When he finally came, I recorded a hilarious unboxing video to send to my friend who was stuck at school-lol. </p>

<p>Starlight was released in 2020 as part of the vintage club. She was limited to 500 pieces and mine has the number 278/500 making her one of my most limited Breyers I have.</p>

<p>Benelli was a limited edition horse in the 2020 Breyerfest Celtic Fling that was held online due to quarantine. To get him in glossy you had to preorder him and he was limited to 2675 pieces.</p>

    <h3>Día de los Muertos</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 2 November 2024</p>

    <p>Today is Día de los Muertos, or the Day of the Dead, a beautiful Mexican holiday that honors and remembers loved ones who have passed away. Last year, I was incredibly privileged to visit Mexico and experience this profound tradition firsthand. Día de los Muertos is celebrated with vibrant colors, elaborate altars (known as ofrendas), and a joyful remembrance of those who have passed. Families come together to create these ofrendas, which are decorated with photos, marigold flowers, candles, and favorite foods of their loved ones, inviting the spirits to visit and celebrate together. It’s a time to remember with joy rather than mourn with sadness, believing that the spirits of those we’ve lost are closer to us than ever on this special day. If you’ve seen the movie Coco, you may already have a good sense of what Día de los Muertos is all about.</p>

<p>Here are some pictures I took while I was there!</p>

<p> Both Breyer and Peter Stone have made horses based on this tradition. For example, Breyer’s Halloween horse in 2017 Calavera and its mini version that came in 2019 are based on the colors and design that are used that day. Moreover, while I was there last year, Stone horses offered this OOAK in best offers! </p>

    <h3>October’s sneak peak</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 31 October 2024</p>

    <p>Breyer sent out this month’s newsletter to the collector club members and there was a sneak peak in it!</p>

<p>I don’t know what this could be… Maybe it’s a vintage or stablemates club release. Maybe it’s not. The colors remind me of Madonna (SM club 2025 release) but without the fleabitten dots. We have to wait to find out! Byeee :)</p>

    <h3>BF 2025 Celebration horse!</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 30 October 2024</p>

    <p>Breyer finally announced the Breyerfest Celebration horse for 2025! It is a gorgeous fleabitten gray and has the name Tight Lines aka Phish. There is also a very nice blanket that comes with the horse! Here is a link to the YouTube video that shows the real horse and it’s story: https://youtu.be/2hqSEvn6YYs?si=UdNan4gfwHnnqFmL</p>

    <h3>Small Updates!</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 29 October 2024</p>

    <p>Hello, everyone! Today I’ll cover a few topics, including Breyer releases, a parcel I’m expecting, a project I’m working on and some other stuff.</p>

    <p>Starting with the Breyer releases, they finally announced the optional release for the Vintage Club, and this year it’s a bit different. Instead of a Traditional scale horse as they usually do, they decided to make a stablemate set of 5 featuring both vintage and modern molds in some older colorways. I have to say that the price tag of $145 plus shipping and handling seems high to me. If we break it down, it’s approximately $30 per stablemate. The good news for some, is that it’s optional, so if you don’t agree with the price, you can simply opt out. Another thing I noticed is that there was no Classic scale model for the club this year, which I thought was a standard feature.</p>

    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/jSRzgTwY/IMG_0450.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>

    <p>Two other models that appeared on a webshop some days ago are two decorators. The first one is Radiance, which is Breyer’s 75th Anniversary horse. Its mold is the classic Arabian mare, released in 2024. The next one is a camo horse, believed to be the 2025 Hope Horse, named Aspire.</p>

    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/4N66Qy31/c2afa6eaac2172abf01483cc2a7769f5ed7a241a_radiance.jpg" width="400" height="400"> <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/yY4hRc7d/image.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>

    <p>I’m not a huge fan of either of these horses. Out of the two, I prefer Radiance because I’ve never liked camo colors.</p>

    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>

    <p>A few days ago, I found a sale ad featuring some very interesting horses, including a volunteer model! The best part was that I really liked it, and it was located in Netherlands, so I wouldn’t have to spend a fortune on shipping and customs or wait too long! The model I’m talking about is the 2012 Breyerfest Volunteer model, Keighley. I’m very excited to add this horse to my collection, but I might have to wait until the 8th of November to unbox her (it’s my second name day because I have two names and wanted to give myself a gift).</p>

    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>

    <p>I’ve started another sculpting project, and I have to say, I’m not very good at it (lol). I’ve tried many times to make a 3D horse but have failed so far. Well, I might get better with practice but idk. I’ll make a post about my attempts in the future, but this is the current one (my best so far because it's a medalion).</p>

    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/7ZXSjR0G/IMG_0483.jpg" width="400" height="400"></center>

    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>

    <p>I don’t know if you saw, but I made myself a logo! This is the original version and the Halloween themed one. The horse was drawn by me a few years ago, and I thought it would fit perfectly with the blog/website theme.</p>

    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/nLyg39tP/6205-B9-F2-AE7-D-4105-AE47-78-BF6-B5-B531-A.png" width="325" height="325"> <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/tgygjx9L/D947F77C-6AD6-4F92-B60F-83D61FC1348E.png" width="325" height="325"></center>

    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>

    <p>Last but not least, the Breyerfest 2025 Celebration Horse will be revealed THIS WEEK!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
    <p>I hope you all have a wonderful day :)</p>

    <h3>Deluxe CC Pin 2025</h3>

    <h3>Breyer Midwest and Mangoky!</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 21 October 2024</p>

    <p>Hello everyone! Today, Breyer made an  announcement about BreyerWest. Many people had been anticipating this change, especially since last year's Denver Rocky Mountain Horse Expo was noticeably under attended. This likely influenced Breyer's decision to relocate the event. Instead of hosting it in Denver, Colorado, this year’s event will take place at EquiFest in Salina, Kansas. Since this location isn’t technically in the West, they’ve also decided to rebrand the event and BreyerWest is now BreyerMidwest! The event is scheduled for March 21-23, 2025.</p>

<center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/0jBcDHRT/101524_Blog-BMW-STD_1800x1000_5a5ac015-ec29-4382-9e63-78b045fe6fa8_1024x1024.webp" width="410" height="248">  </center>

<p>Furthermore, Collector Club members received an email today with the opportunity to enter for the latest model in the Wild Animal Series, named Mangoky. This model is inspired by the Madagascar lemur and the mold used is Valegro, which I think is a brilliant choice. The price is $185, and it will be limited to 750 pieces. If you're a member, you have until October 23 at 11:59 PM EDT to enter.</p>

    <h3>Will the Ideal Series end soon?</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 21 October 2024</p>

    <p>There is a theory circulating that the Orren Mixer's Ideal series might be coming to an end soon. When Breyer first launched the Ideal series, they informed dealers that they planned to conclude the collection with a buckskin horse (they might changed their mind since then). In the latest Holiday catalog that breyer gave out, a buckskin horse on the Geronimo mold appeared (the same mold used for the other horses in the series, with the exception of the pony). This could potentially be the final horse in the series or perhaps a new portrait horse. Alternatively, it might simply be an OOAK from Breyer's archives, used to showcase the western tack set in the advertisement.</p>

    <h3>Breyer 2025 Clubs so far!</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 19 October 2024</p>

    <p>This post might be a bit early, and I’ll likely make another one when we get more details about the three specialty clubs. So far, Breyer has only announced the Collector Club.</p>

    <p>This year looks very exciting just for being in the Collector Club. It appears that there will be another club event, plus a new store exclusively for members to purchase Collector Club merchandise and models. This is a new feature for this year, and we’ll have to wait and see what exactly this store will offer. Additionally, as always, they’ve revealed the first special run, which is Maddox. It is a stunning dapple gray on the Akhal-Teke mold. Some familiar benefits remain unchanged, such as the 10% discount, access to other clubs, workshops, exclusive blogs, and a copy of the JAH magazine (I still haven’t received mine).</p>

<center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/PxFRPXzT/C6-A89946-1-F70-4421-A713-D891-D93-CA3-A3.webp" width="412" height="331">  
  <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/63QPW2ZM/3-BE93191-CACC-417-F-8-CF4-A45-A769-E7-FC1.webp" width="412" height="331"></center>

<p>As for the Deluxe Collector Club, I was right about the mini version of a popular mold, but I never expected there would be two Stablemates! This year, they’ve scaled down the Semi-Rearing Mustang, and members will receive Darius, a Bay Appaloosa, along with an extra Stablemate of the same mold in a random color. Here are the four possible colors:</p>

    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/VvrHtxDM/41-CDF98-C-F3-DC-4-E33-855-E-54-B25490-B51-B.webp" width="412" height="331"></center>

    <p>My favorite is the Wedgewood (solid blue), but I wouldn’t mind getting any of the other options! Along with these Stablemates that ship for free (yay!), you also get a pin featuring Maddox.</p>

    <p><center><span style="color: #00FF00;">Pricing</span></center></p>

<p>The pricing has increased again this year. I believe the club cost $25 in 2023, went up to $30 in 2024, and now it’s $35. The Deluxe option was $65 last year and is now $85 ($70 and $90 respectively for international memberships). If you want to join for the rest of 2024, it’s an additional $10 for each membership. In my opinion, the price increase for the Deluxe option makes sense because it includes an extra Stablemate but the increase in the regular membership fee without any additional Stablemate or pin seems a bit unfair.</p>

<p>I will probably join the Deluxe Collector Club again this year as I really like the Stablemates and will probably also like the pin!</p>

<p><center><span style="color: #2c789c;">Premier, Stablemates and Vintage club</span></center></p>

    <p>Yesterday, someone shared a photo in a Facebook group that shows one release for the 2025 Premier Club and one for the Stablemates Club. I also noticed that the Vintage Club will have 1,200 members this year, which is 200 more than before.</p>

<center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Kj6pD0HW/A8921040-1790-41-C4-B3-C6-092-CAACFBC07.jpg" width="400" height="322"></center>

<p>I was right about the Premier Club too! I expected a new mule mold, and here it is! This makes joining the club very tempting, but I don’t think I will. The second horse in the image is a beautiful Arabian mare with blood marks. Initially, this model looked familiar, and I wasn’t sure if it was new or not. Then I saw a post from modelhorsecollectibility.blogspot.com, which explained that Hagen-Renaker allowed Breyer to scale down one of their models.</p>

<center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/d06Xcmh7/76-D64930-5-FB1-469-D-B815-90-F94-E971349.jpg" width="434" height="260"></center>

<p>We’ll have to wait a few more days until Breyer shares more information about the clubs and their pricing. We’ll probably see every release from the Stablemate Club, at least one from the Vintage Club, and maybe another Premier Club mold without its coloring before the end of the year, as they did last time.</p>

<p>Have a great rest of your weekend!</p>

    <h3>A few Breyer Updates</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 19 October 2024</p>

    <p>Happy weekend everyone! Today's post is going to be a bit long, as Breyer announced several things that I’ll cover them all here!</p>

    <p>First, Breyer has released this year's holiday Mare and Foal set. Freya & Annika come packaged in a beautiful bag that includes an extra ornament in their colors, which I find very cute and amazing. When I saw this set, I considered buying it because they are not unicorns or decorators like last years. If I make another purchase from Breyer's website, I might add them to my cart. Another release is this year's classic winter decorator named Nor'easter. To be honest, I’m not a big fan of it. I’m quite picky when it comes to decorators, and this one doesn’t look like a model I’d add to my collection. Of course, they also released some holiday merchandise, such as hoodies, mugs, pillows, etc., but the item that caught my attention the most is a throw blanket that features the cover of Breyer's 1963 catalog. They also made 3 holiday blankets that are shipped randomly, but my favourite has to be the bottom one...</p>

<center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/gkQHH7GS/F1-B966-EA-5150-4-AAE-BE8-D-4-A9-F105-F0630.png" width="412" height="309"></center>

<p>Next year is the 75th anniversary and they of course added some merchandise items for this occasion. This includes some clothing items, a pin, a mug, and two blankets for traditional horses.</p>

    <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/qMzGnrH6/69-BEA993-AD87-4494-BBF2-C1-E8-DF8-CB603.png" width="412" height="309"></center>

    <p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>

    <p>Now, here are some other interesting updates that I’ll go through quickly:</p>
<p>1. Breyer has announced the list of models that will be retired by the end of 2024, which you can check out <a href="https://www.breyerhorses.com/blogs/news/the-2024-breyer-retired-list">here</a>.</p>

<p>2. Yesterday, Collector Club members had the chance to get a free glossy regular run model with the Collector Club appreciation offer, but it sold out within 2 hours.</p>

<p>3. Today is the National Fun Day, which includes online workshops open to everyone! You can find more information about that <a href="https://www.breyerhorses.com/blogs/news/national-fun-day-2024-schedule-and-locations">here</a>.</p>

<p><center>__  _______________  __</center></p>

    <p>Lastly, the Collector Club membership for 2025 has opened, and there are some exciting stuff about it. Plus, I just saw a post featuring one Premier Club model and a release for the Stablemate Club (I’m not entirely sure if this mold is new or not). I’ll make another post later today or tomorrow to dive into those details!!</p>

<p>As always thank you so much for reading this! See you in the next one very soon :)</p>

    <h3>Collection Showcase #4</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 15 October 2024</p>

    <p>October means Oktoberfest! (This post was intended to go up earlier in the month, but I forgot.) What better way to celebrate than by showing you some of the Breyerfest 2022 models, as the theme was Prost!</p>

    <p><center><span style="color: #000000;">Nikolas</span></center></p>

    <p>Nikolas was the celebration model for that year. He was sculpted by Bridgette Eberl, and the first release of the mold was actually on him! As you might know, I got my first Breyer Traditional horse at the beginning of 2022, so that was the first year I wanted to join Breyerfest. I bought an online Traditional Access ticket, which came with Nikolas. I remember watching this <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7q1wwxbik?feature=shared">video</a> and getting very excited. During BreyerFest, I didn't get any other model except Nikolas, but when he finally arrived all the way from the US, I was very impressed! According to the IDYB page, 12.354 of these were made.</p>

    <p><center><span style="color: #DD0000;">Brahms</span></center></p>

    <p>Brahms was a present from my parents for my 18th birthday! He was a special run for that year, but I got him from a shop in Europe the next year (instead of during BreyerFest). I really liked the Big Ben mold, and I've always loved leopard Appaloosa horses, which made this particular model really stand out to me, especially in the glossy finish. The run number is 2.200.</p>

    <p><center><span style="color: #FFCC00;">Chablis</span></center></p>

    <p>I got this horse during BreyerFest 2024, two years after its release! To be honest, I never considered getting this horse until I saw him in the background of a video. The real horse is very beautiful, and I think Breyer did an amazing job creating its portrait model (the Idocus mold fits perfectly). Both online and in-person BreyerFest attendees could get him in the store. Chablis is a limited edition with 3.000 pieces made. Sadly, mine doesn't have many dapples, but it was the one I could find at a reasonable price, so I don't mind that much.</p>

            <h3>Hot Cocoa</h3>
            <p class="date">Published on 10 October 2024</p>

<p>Hello everyone! Do you remember this sneak peak?</p>

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/tCp3PsMd/6-F0-EE1-FD-073-B-4-AE1-8471-75-F3-B906-EBE3.jpg" width="400" height="400">

<p>It was in fact this year’s pony for Christmas! It’s really frustrating that whenever I purchase something from Breyer’s website and pay a small fortune on shipping, the next day they release something amazing like this pony! I’m not sure if I will get it but I love it! Hot cocoa is such a cozy theme and the blanket is very beautiful!</p>

<p>I don’t know if anyone reads my blog but if you do please read this: I've been feeling really low these past few days, knowing that I’ll soon have to say goodbye to my beloved grandma. It's such a difficult time right now, and I’m struggling to find any motivation to write or do much of anything. I’m sorry if I don’t post for a while (I have 2 posts that are ready and will probably use those instead of nothing).</p>

            <h3>2025 Clubs speculations</h3>
            <p class="date">Published on 6 October 2024</p>

<p>Happy Sunday! It’s finally October, the time of year when Breyer typically announces next year’s clubs! I’ve been thinking about what they might do for 2025, and I wanted to share my speculations and ideas with you.</p>

<p><center><span style="color: #2c789c;">Collector Club</span></center></p>

<p>For the Collector’s Club I have no idea on what they could do. The only thing I can think of is that they might feature vintage molds/colorways. As for the exclusive Stablemate for the deluxe membership, my guess is that it will be a miniaturized version of a popular traditional mold but that is not unique as they have done that before.</p>

<p><center><span style="color: #2c789c;">Stablemates Club</span></center></p>

<p>About the Stablemates Club, I believe they’ll continue shrinking popular molds from different decades. There are typically six releases (plus one optional model), and I expect each to represent a horse from a particular era, ending with a brand-new, modern sculpture as they do every year. They could scale down some beloved molds from previous decades that collectors have been eager to see as Stablemates. Imagine a mini Ethereal!!</p>

<p><center><span style="color: #2c789c;">Premier Club</span></center></p>

<p>I have two ideas for the Premier Club next year. The first is that Breyer could introduce new sculptures people have been asking for, such as a Friesian, a donkey, or even a mule. The second idea seems a lot unlikely to happen but they could bring back sculptors from the past who created iconic molds. They could remake their original works in a modern style. While it’s more likely that Breyer would hire newer sculptors to do this, having the original artists return would make the molds extremely special and iconic.</p>

<p><center><span style="color: #2c789c;">Vintage Club</span></center></p>

<p>Next year’s Vintage Club is going to be interesting, especially with Breyer celebrating its 75th anniversary. Typically, each release in this club honors Breyer’s history, but I think for such a milestone, they’ll do something truly exciting and different. While I can’t pinpoint exactly what, I believe Breyer will surprise everyone with something unique to mark this important occasion.</p>

       </center>

<p>All in all, I’m really interested to see what next year will bring. It’s definitely going to be fun! Have a nice rest of the day :)</p>

            <h3>Collection Showcase #3</h3>
            <p class="date">Published on 3 October 2024</p>

      
<p>Happy Spooktober! Today, I will be showing you one model from each of Peter Stone’s scales!</p>

<p>First, we have an adorable Chip horse on the Quarter Horse mold. I acquired this model from a Stablemate lot, and unfortunately, I don’t have much information on when it was produced or how limited it is.</p>

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/2S77td5s/410-CBD34-2-F1-F-4-A12-8-C19-84816666315-D.jpg" width="403" height="302">

<p>Next is the Pebbles scale! I found this beautiful Warmblood at a great price, and I couldn’t resist buying it. I believe it was a regular run in the early 2000s, but I’m not completely sure.</p>

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/tTYd7Lzb/6-E242626-1-D25-46-F4-B8-F5-860-A40-D9656-A.jpg" width="403" height="302">

<p>The last and largest scale is the Stone (1:9). I have two Stone horses, and today I’ll show you Cutter. He’s on the ISH (Ideal Stock Horse) mold, and he was a regular run released in 2002.</p>

            <h3>September's CC sneak peak</h3>
            <p class="date">Published on 30 September 2024</p>

<p>Happy Monday! Breyer teased an upcoming release that will be revealed next month. I’m not sure what the horse will be, but I have a feeling it could be a web special or the Christmas pony for this year, though I could be totally wrong!</p>

    <h3>Breyer Club releases</h3>
    <p class="date">Published on 24 September 2024</p>

<p>Hi everyone! Breyer released even more horses today.</p>

<p>The first one is the 4th Vintage Club release: "Outlaw", a gambler's choice on the Buckshot mold. These are the 3 colors:</p>

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Jn53PkF5/A9-BE9176-2211-403-D-A2-D0-19-EB23-C60863.webp" width="412" height="331">

<p>My favorite is the blanket Appaloosa, but I would be happy with either the buckskin or paint. Sadly, I’m not in the Vintage Club this year, but I hope I can join next year.</p>

<p>This year's Vintage Club bonus stablemate is Felix, and it comes inside the box with Outlaw.</p>

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/C5MGtKTT/A449-C420-AB7-E-4-F13-B72-F-8-B9-BEA4-C3679.webp" width="412" height="331">

<p>Horatio is here! Many Collector Club members who chose the Deluxe subscription can order the bonus stablemate and pin free of charge. I’m so happy I don’t have to pay for shipping!</p>

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/MT9ZrQ0x/dlxsm-product-480x480.webp" width="400" height="400">

<p>I’m not sure why they didn’t announce him 5 days earlier (when Antonia was released) so that people who wanted Antonia could add Horatio to their order and not have to make a separate one. To me, that would’ve been better since I wouldn’t have to wait for two parcels.</p>

<p>In other news, I managed to find Calista from a shop in England!</p>

            <h3>Collection Showcase #2</h3>
            <p class="date">Published on 22 September 2024</p>

      
<p>In the first collection showcase I showed you my first model horse and my first Breyer stablemates. Today I will introduce you to the first 2 traditional horses I ever got.</p>

<p>My first Traditionals were a New Year's gift in 2022. In Greece, many families don’t open gifts on December 25th but wait until January 1st, after the new year begins. That’s when I opened mine, and the first traditional horse I saw was Catch Me! I was completely shocked at how big he was. I wasn’t expecting a plastic horse to be that large, since I was only used to Schleichs and Stablemates. Then I opened Theo, the horse I had been most excited about. Owning a Traditional horse was something I had wanted for a long time. In 2020, I discovered the hobby and Breyer horses, and I really wanted to be part of it. Unfortunately, being in Europe meant I had to spend a lot to get them from the US, so I gave up on the idea for a while. Before Christmas in 2021, my dad asked me what I wanted for the holidays, and I mentioned that a Breyer horse would be amazing, but I couldn’t find any in Europe. Later that day, he easily found a store in Germany that sold them (I felt pretty silly for not finding it myself!) and told me to pick two. For my first models, I chose Theo, whom I adored, and I specifically wanted a sport or warmblood horse to start with so I chose Catch Me.</p>

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/158KjKrY/CBFA8396-EB2-B-4-ACE-8160-AB75-ADE3-A56-F.jpg" width="403" height="302">

<p>Catch me was released in 2019 and he is a regular run model.</p>

<p>Theo was released in 2021  and he is also a regular run model.</p>

            <h3>Holiday 2024 Playset</h3>
            <p class="date">Published on 20 September 2024</p>

      
<p>I found a picture of this years holiday pony playset! It is called "Holiday Pijama Party" and the price will be $60.</p>

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/7Zb8XY9y/B-HP-10116-Holiday-Pajama-Party-50696.jpg" width="410" height="317">

<p>This theme is really cute!  The blanket matches perfectly with the red halter and the teddy bear is the very cute. Sadly I am not a doll fan and that is probably the reason why I don't have any playset from Breyer yet. However I really like the doll's clothes as they fit with the horse's tack!</p>

            <h3>Update</h3>
            <p class="date">Published on 19 September 2024</p>

      
<p>I ended up getting Antonia and because she was $65, I also got Norwich without exceeding the $100 for the shipping (if it’s more than $100 the shipping cost gets higher).</p>

   <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/z3YZwbpz/60-AC1-D88-3-FE9-48-F2-AB7-D-ACE72-A51-EC47.webp" width="412" height="331">

<p>Now I have to wait for around 3-4 weeks but I am really happy I got these two horses!</p>

            <h3>New releases!</h3>
            <p class="date">Published on 18 September 2024</p>

<p>Happy Wednesday, everyone! Today, Breyer announced three new models, and I'd like to share my thoughts on them. Starting off we have my least favourite which is a decorator on the newsworthy mold.</p>

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/GhVF5Bzk/B-TR-10066-Fall-Dec-2024-Zulu-1024x1024.webp" width="427" height="370">

<p>This pony was teased in the August Collector’s Club newsletter, and now it's finally been fully revealed. Zulu is a limited edition available for purchase on Breyer's website and in retail stores. While I think the color and the gloss is pretty cool, I generally don't collect decorator models unless I'm absolutely in love with one (like I was with Neva). For that reason, I don’t think I’ll be adding Zulu to my collection.</p>

<p>Next, we have Calista. When I first saw this horse, I hoped she’d be a regular run because I absolutely love her. The chestnut coat looks stunning on this mold but unfortunately for me, she’s a brick and mortar special run, meaning I can’t get her at retail price and will likely have to buy her from a reseller. The same happened with Kendall but thankfully I found one new in box in Germany!</p>

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/WpKq2BrV/B-TR-10007-Calista-Brick-Mortar-01-1024x1024.webp" width="425" height="290">

<p>Lastly, Breyer sent an email to Collector’s Club members about Antonia. She was first revealed during BreyerFest, but tomorrow, September 19, at 1:00pm EDT, she will go on sale. While I really like her, I’m still undecided about whether to purchase her or not. I might wait to see her price and if something else from the website exclusives catches my eye to help me decide. There is always the option to opt out and save money for another model!</p>

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/wjRVq53f/091124-SOC-IG-B-CS-10041-Antonia-CC-1080x1080-KM-22123b40-ed17-4e07-9449-41c30d5136c5-844x844.webp" width="420" height="420">

<p>Thank you for reading that. If anyone wants to sell a Calista at cost and ship her to Europe please let me know.</p>

            <h3>My model horse plans</h3>
            <p class="date">Published on 14 September 2024</p>

<p>Happy Saturday! Today I will tell you a bit more about the plans I have for my collection. They are basically four, but I am really excited about them.</p>

<p>First of all, I really want to start showing. I don’t know much about it yet, but it looks like a lot of fun. Unfortunately, in my country, there aren’t many collectors, so live showing would be impossible. The only option is photo showing, which also seems fun. Last year, I made an account on <a href="https://www.omhps.com">OMHPS</a> and entered some classes (I placed 1st twice with two horses, but no other placings), and then I quit. Next year, I might enter the Breyer Bootcamp, but I will have to read the description and rules first. Another plan is to join the Vintage Club this year. In the past, I really wanted to join the Premier Club, but after a while, I really enjoyed the Vintage Club releases and how they celebrate Breyer’s history. I also wanted to join last year, but I decided to try the Collector’s Club instead to see how things work and next year, I will probably try to get a spot.</p>

<p>The other two plans involve crafting. Almost since I started collecting Breyers, I’ve wanted to make my own model horse and 3d print it. I started one project, but it failed. Then I began a second one, which didn’t fail as badly, but let’s just say it wasn’t great. My third attempt was nice (at least to me). The problem is that I don’t have a 3D printer, and without one, I can’t do much. Now I want to try and make a medallion, which won’t be too hard to mold and cast if i succeed. I will talk more about the 3D horses I’ve made (tried to make at least) in another post. Last but not least, I want to make a simple diorama to take pictures of my models. I’ve gotten many ideas over the past couple of months, and I think I’m ready to start building it!</p>

            <h3>Collection Showcase #1</h3>
            <p class="date">Published on 10 September 2024</p>

            <p> Welcome to the first collection showcase! In this series, I’ll be sharing my models, explaining how and where I got them, along with some additional interesting details about each one. </p>

<p>For the first showcase, I decided to show you my first ever Schleich (my first model horse ever), and my first stablemates that started my love for Breyer horses.</p>

<p>My first ever model horse was a Schleich Friesian. I don’t remember exactly when I got it, but I do recall being at a toy store near my house, where there was a stand filled with Schleich animals, including horses. After picking up that Friesian, I started buying more both to collect and to play with. Schleichs became my favorite childhood toy, and since then I have collected many. While I don’t plan to feature them all here, I might share some of the ones that hold special meaning to me.</p>

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/kM8CxNRH/IMG-0065.jpg" width="403" height="302">

<p>The next model is my first ever Breyer horse! It was sometime around 2017 and I was out with my family when i entered a hobby store. They had some Stablemates on display for just €2, and they immediately caught my eye. I spent a bit of time looking at them, unsure which one to choose, but eventually, I decided on the Hanoverian gelding. When we sat down to eat at a restaurant, I unpacked the horse and was truly amazed with its quality. I had expected the figure to be made of soft plastic, but it was much sturdier and of far better quality than I imagined. I was so impressed that I went straight back to the store and bought a few more! </p>

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/wMKdCMZF/IMG-0062.jpg" width="403" height="302">

<p>These are the other Stablemates that were available in the store. I don’t quite remember which ones I bought on the day I found the Hanoverian gelding, as I ended up revisiting the store a few months later and purchased the rest!</p>

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/kXmmwVxg/IMG-0063.jpg" width="483" height="290">

<p>As you can see I have played a lot with these horses.</p>

<p>Thank you all for reading that, if you like it please let me know in the comment box. In the next showcase I will show you the first 2 traditional horses I ever got! </p>

            <h3>Upcoming Peter Stone molds</h3>
            <p class="date">Published on 7 September 2024</p>

            <p> The Peter Stone company changed owners early this year. During the announcement live stream they also revealed two brand new sculptures. One mare with the name Volo and her foal Pimento!</p>

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Dfqn2tbj/F1111-F6-A-E479-4993-ADB7-5-AF29-DE4558-D.jpg" width="400" height="400">

<p> A few days ago, I came across a post showcasing a new Chip Draft foal named Violet (I was so happy when I saw this one because chips are so adorable). In the image it's just the prototype of the horse, and of course, not the final product.</p>

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/gjqWNZWF/AB3-B4932-9-DEB-44-B8-8-E6-B-C4-DE58-BE0603.jpg" width="400" height="400">

<p>All these amazing sculptures were created by the talented Maggie Jenner-Bennett. In my opinion, the recent additions to the Peter Stone collection are incredibly exciting. It feels like the company is expanding, which suggests they’ll continue to release even more amazing pieces. I truly love Stone horses, but the newer models seem a bit pricey to me, leaving me with mixed feelings. I admire them, but they’re just out of my reach. However, if the company continues to grow, perhaps the prices will become more affordable in the future.</p>

<p>I got all these images from Peter Stone’s social media.</p>

            <h3>Breyerfest Haul 2024</h3>
            <p class="date">Published on 6 September 2024</p>

            <p>Hello again! I’m a bit late to the party, but here’s my Breyerfest 2024 haul! This was my third online Breyerfest, and I purchased some of the models before the event and some a bit afterward.</p>
            <p>The first horse I got was Kirk! When I saw the promo for the 2024 Vintage Club, I knew I had to get Kirk at some point because he's a Nightlamb. As soon as Breyer released him, I quickly searched for him on eBay and managed to snag one! He became the most expensive horse in my collection, but I have zero regrets about it.</p>

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/bYnGY8St/54126-FEF-D32-F-415-F-81-B0-36-C790010-BD8.jpg" width="403" height="302">

            <p>Next up are the models I got straight from the Breyerfest store. In the Special Run preference form I filled out in June, I selected the Surprise Model and Fighter & Survivor. Initially, I wasn't planning on getting both because it would be quite expensive, but I figured I'd wait to see the surprise variations and mold first before deciding. I also had my eye on the Limited Edition Stablemate, Wild Things. (Last year, I missed out on Buggy, a horse I loved.) In the end, I sold my Surprise horse even though I liked every variation, and instead, I got Fighter & Survivor and Wild Things.</p>

<p>For Wild Things, I was initially hoping for the standard variation, but when I opened it and saw the green one, I instantly changed my mind and fell in love with it.</p>
<br>
<p>Of course, I also got my Athenian Lady with my online ticket! I was really nervous about the condition of the models that Breyer would send, but thankfully, mine arrived undamaged.</p>

<p>The next model I picked up was on the Monday after the Breyerfest weekend, from a seller in Europe. I found Chablis at what I thought was a great price (especially for Europe), and I couldn't let such a pretty model slip through my fingers!</p>

<p>Last but not least, while browsing eBay just for fun, I came across one of my grails: Lillian and Molly (the 2019 Vintage Club model). I couldn’t find any other listings for this set, so I decided to get it because who knows when I'd have another chance to find this pair!

<p>All in all, this was my Breyerfest 2024 haul. I really enjoyed this year's live broadcast, workshops, live auction, and more. I’m already looking forward to Breyerfest 2025 and seeing what Breyer has in store for their 75th anniversary!!</p>
