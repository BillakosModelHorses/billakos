Hi again! I actually joined collector club this year for the same time and wanted to see how that would be. There is no obligation to buy any model and there are some other perks that I enjoy a lot . I got both Heath and Antonia and even though they were expensive, I havenâ€™t regretted it (I had to pay a lot on shipping and customs). Horatio was a fun surprise because you could place an order for free! For next year I decided to join the deluxe collector club again. I was planning on joining vintage club but with the latest change to the prices, all the releases would cost me $1100+ (without Counting the extra model) and giving my spot to someone would be hard as the run numbers increased. I might join stablemates club but I will wait to see all the releases first before I decide if itâ€™s really worth it. Premier club lookes very interested but I will probably wonâ€™t join for the same reasons as the vintage club.

Donâ€™t leave them in boxes for too long or youâ€™ll forget what you have!ðŸ¤£ I know itâ€™s hard being International but do you join any of the Breyer Clubs? I havenâ€™t joined for next year yet but usually join the Premier Club

Hello Pam! Welcome to the Paddock Chat!! I donâ€™t really know how many Schleich I have but probably more than Breyers. At least more than my traditionals. Unfortunately I donâ€™t have much space so I stored my Schleich horses carefully in boxes and kept out the special ones.

Pam wrote:

Hi Billy! What a nice page you set up! Iâ€™ve been spending time re-visiting my Breyer collection by opening up the boxes Iâ€™ve been storing them in to get them on their new shelves. Discovered I have 2 of some models as I havenâ€™t seen them since 2009! I keep my Schleichs on my desk cuz I donâ€™t worry if they accidentally get knocked over. Do you have more Breyers now than you do Schleichs?

How are you guys? I am a bit stressed at the moment because I have a test in my university tomorrowâ€¦
